Falling “real” interest rates reflect falling inflation A country’s Balance of payments comprises its current account and capital account. The current account shows the net amount a country is earning if it is in surplus, or spending if it is in deficit. It is the sum of the balance of trade (net earnings on exports less payments for imports), factor income (earnings on foreign investments less payments made to foreign investors) and cash transfers. phases of economy expansion

can't beat market and will be arbitraged away In the majority of OTC markets (interbank wholesale markets) it is the custom for the calling counterparty (market user) to ask the market maker for his two way price (to Buy/Sell in foreign exchange markets and the Borrow/lend in interest rate markets – though some interest rate/discount rate based short term securities can also be ‘bought’ and ‘sold’ in these markets). The logic is the same regardless of market concerned.

want to find a seller market makes buy at the bid and sell at the offer/ask. the ask price is how much they're asking for it. you buy at their asking price and they bid for your selling price
so if you pay 52 for 5 and increase the bid, it means people will be able to sell at a higher price so they can more easily find a seller.
if you offer 2 at 27, you're decreasing the offer price, meaning it's cheaper to buy so it's more likely to find a buyer. BBS, SOB

A swap deal comprises two deals (spot against forward)
The percentage is reduced still further when the forward deals are considered. A swap deal comprises two deals (spot against forward) and again the initial interbank transaction will give rise the further swap deals being effected. The result of all this activity brings the percentage of customer deals overall to approximately 5 to 7 % of all transactions in the market. This is the way the foreign exchange market generates its own liquidity. These sequences of transaction ensure that the next time this or another customer calls a bank the dealer will be able to find a price in the market and quote the customer accordingly.
iii) The more sophisticated corporate customers also tend to deal on this basis preferring to choose their moment of entry into the spot market [2] and then extending the position forward to the required date using a foreign exchange swap [3]. page 142, taking less notes now for speedAs noted earlier in this chapter, the forward swap points, the standard method of quotation in the forward foreign exchange market, are equivalent to the interest rate differential between the two currencies involved.<br>

A Time or Delivery option forward exchange contract is defined as a forward contract where the delivery date of the foreign currency is at the customer's option
Should the full amount not be able to be settled by the final date of the option period, then a spot exchange deal reversing the initial operation must be effected to "CLOSE-OUT" the balance of the option contract
n-d-f = non-deliverable forward
A foreign exchange swap is defined as ‘a simultaneously dealt set of two linked exchange transactions involving the purchase and the sale of an identical amount of one currency against a countercurrency with differing maturities, most frequently spot value against a forward value date’.

Forward/forward foreign exchange swap Example
As already mentioned, as with any forward exchange transaction the now withdrawn ACI Model Code requires that all forward rates should reflect the current spot exchange rate. It is therefore important that in the case of forward/forward swap transactions both legs are based on the current spot rate, i.e. in this 3s v. 6s example the three months forward rate should be the spot rate at the time of dealing adjusted by the three months swap points and the six months exchange rate should be the spot rate at the time of dealing adjusted by the six months swap points.
You can determine the spot rate or forward rate or forward swap points from each other (they ask this)<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="ACI Textbook1.pdf > page=161&amp;selection=88,0,88,45" data-href="ACI Textbook1.pdf#page=161&amp;selection=88,0,88,45" href="resources/attachments/aci-textbook1.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ACI Textbook1, page 161</a>

To obtain finance against a Bill of Exchange, the instrument (the Bill of Exchange) has to be discounted

To be able to be compared to a simple interest rate (yield) a discount rate must be converted onto the same basis as the yield rate. This is done using the discount to yield formula. A discount rate will always appear numerically to be lower than its equivalent yield rate. This is because the return (the interest or discount amount earned) is the result of applying the discount rate to the face or maturity value – a larger amount than the price paid for the instrument. To achieve the same return on the amount invested (the price) a numerically higher rate of return must be achieved.

Secondary market small
In the US CP can be issued for periods ranging from 1 day to 270 days with the most active issues being in issues of under 30 days. The 270 day maximum maturity is to avoid the necessity of registering the issue with the SEC (any instrument with a maturity in excess of 270 days is deemed to be a bond and must be so registered). For this reason a lot of US based corporate issuers use a technique of ‘rolling’ (renewing) a series of 270 day issues.

no hard copy nominal value: Every bond has a fixed value or redemption value – often referred to as nominal value. This is the amount the issuer will repay at maturity if the terms of the issue state that the bond will be redeemed ‘at par’. However, the redemption value of some types of bond can be higher than their nominal value – depending on the specific terms of the issue US usually issued at $1000 UK is 100 bond is priced as percentage of par IR up, bond price down and vice versa If the price of a bond is above PAR: this means that it is trading at a premium over face value and current interest rates must be lower than the coupon rate offered on the bond.
If the price of a bond is below PAR:
this means that it is trading at a discount against face value and current interest rates must be higher than the coupon rate offered on the bond. Clean vs Dirty Bond prices are generally quoted ‘clean’, i.e. without accrued interest. If the accrued interest is included in the price, the price is known as the ‘dirty’ price Short term US government debt – US Treasury Bills are money market instruments. are issued by the US Treasury for 91 days, 182 days and 52 weeks 2 types: notes - 2 to 10 years

Thus a default on the collateral (however unthinkable in respect of government debt) would require the seller to supply new collateral Because of the fixed price of the repurchase (i.e. in cash driven transactions the same as the initial consideration plus repo interest), any fall in the price of the collateral is automatically a loss to the seller and any rise in the price of the collateral is automatically a gain bond's clean price is what is usually quoted (remember without interest) quoted per 100 (par) For example, in the case of Gilts this could be 98.50 meaning GBP 98.50 per GBP 100 face value sum of present value of all future cashflows (cashflow discount model)
Pricing above/below par: As bonds are typically fixed income securities they may be priced below, at or above par value.
Bond prices below the par value: indicate that current interest rates are higher than the bond coupon
meaning an investor to achieve current interest rates overall must buy at a discount Bond prices above the par value indicate that current interest rates must be lower than the bond coupon
meaning an investor, to achieve current interest rates overall is prepared to pay a premium. The relationship of current interest rates v. fixed income bonds means that when interest rates are rising the price of a bond falls and where interest rates are falling the price of a bond rises Dirty Price aka "all-in" price or "gross" price
which takes clean price and adds accrued interest
The dirty price is the price at which the securities can be sold in the secondary market (cash bonds). If repo collateral is not valued at its dirty price, the buyer of the collateral would pay less for the securities through the repo than he could make by selling them into the secondary market. Not only would the seller have lost the use of this amount, but it would also represent an interest free loan and an unsecured credit exposure to the buyer UK GOV bonds -&gt; ACT/ACT <br><img alt="Pasted image 20250129203756.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250129203756.png" target="_self"> Repo cash driven trade dirty price is important and is used as initial consideration

Margin threshold defined by GMRA (global master repurchase agreement) MtM when move my percentage agreed and trigger margin call
and threshold crossed by "material" (agreed upon) value Margin calls triggered when collateral shortfall exceeds the variation margin
The party being called for variation margin has the right to choose whether margin shall be delivered in securities or cash
variation margin triggered by collateral price movement can be absolute or proportional movement but it's an agreed upon value
alternative approaches to VM calls is to "closing out" original transaction and re-open with new terms to reflect movement in value of collateral.
requires a repurchase date (maturity) -&gt; of original transaction is now the date which the repricing is to be effected and you enter a new repo transaction which is a repriced transaction:
terms i) securities collateral remains same ii) opening date reset = repricing date.
initial consideration now recalculated -&gt; multiplied by margin ratio = market value of secs on repricing date iii) close out amount of OG transaction is compared to repriced. get net payment from one party to other and has to be made within time frame agreed in GMRA (global master repurchase agreement) iv) repurchase date (maturity) of OG trans., repo rate and marg ratio remain same as OG trans. whole thing means repo is adjusted to match repriced collateral for remaining period or until such date when change in value is to be deemed "material" (included in GMRA (global material repurchase agreement)) coupon payments and interest on collateral returned to seller (repoer)

Merged into ISDA
Definition non-transferable ("off-balance sheet") (no exchange of principal amount takes place)
agreement between two counterparties, usually banks, developed to protect the parties against a future adverse movement in interest rates.
Counterparties to an FRA agree an interest rate to be applied to a notional deposit of an agreed principal amount for a specified period of time from a specified future date, known as the settlement date
like forward except no exchange of funds
or futures without margin requirements
unwinding and contractual obligation: non-negotiable and non-assignable
can be unwound if no longer required
lifted by doing an equal and opposite transaction with a different counterparty
when both transactions are left to settle on the appropriate date or with the same counterparty where it can be agreed to calculate the forward dated settlement difference and then discount the amount and pay on cancellation date (removing any residual credit (market replacement / delivery) risk The Buyer of an FRA seeks to protect himself against a rise in interest rates, the Seller seeks protection against a fall in interest rates. In an FRA you are in effect buying or selling the interest rate. buy/sell logic is opposite to futures market
buying FRA is like borrowing money while selling is like lending the money Not linked to loan or deposit there is no exchange of physical principal The counterparties agree that on settlement date the contractual rate for the FRA is compared against a market rate benchmark (Settlement rate) and the discounted difference is paid over by the one to the other counterparty. think of the calculation

The FRA allows you to hedge against interest rates to a settlement date (fixing date) so effectively you can buy certainty and fix and interest rate to be paid for a forward/forward period. therefore it is an interest rate equivalent to an outright forward exchange contract you can fix the interest rate to be higher or lower than the benchmark rate then fix it to be paid for the forward/forward period Pricing FRA's Pricing FRA from forward/forward use it to get BID and OFFER FRA rates
can use forward/forward formula from CH5

forward rate is the difference rate between the long period and the short period BID: Long date bid / short date Offer OFFER Long date offer / short date bid think numerator matches what you want and then use opposite as short one Pricing FRA from Futures strip futures price to forward = 100 - fwd/fwd
e.g. future = 93.22 -&gt; (100 - 6.78 (from fwd/fwd))
forward/forward rate is gotten by compounding (multiplying) the 2 forward/forward IR's implied (derived from) the futures prices. you get the 2 futures prices from first date you want, e.g. 3m and then second date e.g. 6m
you can compound them because they don't generate cashflows futures -&gt; Act/360

hedging short term interest rate risks in the floating side of the swaps book
‘assisting’ in liquidity management (offsetting some of the costs between shorter term low yielding liquid assets and the longer term liabilities taken in funding)
a trading substitute for “on balance sheet” position taking (taking a view on and trading interest rates)
arbitraging FRAs v. Futures contracts
providing a corporate customer service (perhaps better placed first on this list for some banks). For Corporate treasurers budgeting and planning extending price availability for longer term projects Pro's to FRA's (summary of benefits) FRA = CFD in BoE (England)
Used for IR protection only
Extremely liquid as MM's are willing to quote prices in any currency &amp; period up to 2 - 2.5 yr horizon
OTC therefore tailer made
Flexible so good for hedging
Better for managing IR risk over longer period than cash markets can
FRA rate is determined by the market, reflecting the pricing of Fwd/fwd periods coming off of the cash market yield curve
FRA market is quoted and dealt akin to cash markets so no need for steep learning curve like other products
No up front premium or margin to pay when entering into an FRA
Can be unwound easily by entering into equal and opposite FRA so true definition of hedge
All FRA outstanding's of "off balance sheet" Credit risk for FRA's is low and so is credit utilisation which is good for both buyer and seller (bank and corporate) credit risk is asymmetric if on mtm, the settlement of FRA will result in the bank getting the difference then it is deemed to be the risk utilisation under the limit granted
If on mtm the bank would pay the difference, then it is taken as 'zero risk'.
low risk in terms of capital requirements hedging vs trading hedging can be used to hedge against underlying cash market positions
then show the hedge as the risk position being hedged and show this generation of some form of 'pseudo' cash movement in your reporting of cashflows you make for your cash market positions management
now it is usually dynamically updated with cashflows, mismatch reports and on-screen mtm evaluation.
usually need one or more systems to consolidate cross market instruments and risks to identify etc. trading similar to fin IR futures when dealing on trading basis need to be readily accessible in a portfolio so that a dealer can when need be sell or buy back to contract to close the position (and realise the profit).
They get settled individually on settlement date and remain in portfolio until that date.
If a FRA position is taken as a trading position it will be marked to market on a daily basis and any profit and loss will be taken into account immediately. Financial Futures
- definition
- agreement to b/s standard amount of specified commodity/currency/instrument at fixed price on fixed future date
- Sold on exchanges as either electronically or open outcry
- can either go long or short on any day up until predefined last trading date
- All standardised so readily traded until last trading date
- CME started trading futures in IMM (international Money Market) (Money Market = liquid short term market)
- CME Group represents the merger of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and its commodity exchange division, Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX). The merger was completed in 2007.
- Open outcry = via voice and hand signals on trading floor
- Screen based / electronically is now more available and used.
- ICE
- LIFFE = London International Financial Futures Exchange, later merged with LTOM (London Traded Options Market) in 2013
- took over NYSE Euronext
- started off as Open Outcry but then evolved to electronic trading platform
- Electronic trading platform = ICE Connect
- Uses API's
- Futures contracts can be taken off the market if unpopular like Eurodollar but then reintroduced later on IMM of CME and SGX
- Delivery Dates
- Typically on 4 quarter dates:
- March
- June
- September
- December
- Run for 90 days from delivery date (3rd Wednesday)
- So to hedge a June - Sep risk, you'd use a June Contract.
- Current nearest dates = FRONT MONTHS
- STIR = SHORT TERM INTEREST RATE FUTURES
- Pricing of STIR's
- Quoted on index basis (100 - IR)
- Inverse relationship to IR
- When IR's are falling, futures price rise
- When IR's are rising, futures price fall<br>

- With implied 3 months forward/forward interest rates (3 v. 6) at 5.00 p.c. the equivalent Futures price would be traded at around 95.00 (100 - 5.00). If forward/forward implied interest rates then fall to 4.00 p.c. the Futures price will rise to approximately 96.00.
- Price of money in MMs is IR payable
- The money markets deal in cash i.e. funds are delivered either value today (Sterling markets) or on spot date (Eurocurrency markets) for all deposits/loans effected today.
- Futures prices can show the markets expectations for similar cash deposits for 3m periods in the future from those quarter month delivery dates.
- can be used to determine yield curves for IRs

- Role of London Clearing House (ICE Clear (ICEU))
- ICE Clear was formerly known as LCH.Clearnet and ICCH (the International Commodities Clearing House). Screen based trading systems such as ICE CONNECT are automatically linked into Clearing systems.
- Once the system has matched all trades the Clearing House assumes the role of second party to all trades, becoming buyer to each seller and seller to each buyer.
- This eliminates credit risk for the exchange's clearing members as well as facilitating the process of entering into and closing out transactions.
- Once the trades have been agreed between the Clearing House and the clearing member (normally early the next day) the Clearing House will effectively issue the guarantee of performance.
- Margining
- Initial Margin
- Deposit like a minimum security deposit
- level of IM is determined/standardised by contract and set by CH
- Variation Margin
- each member working with CH will have their net open position marked to market daily by the CH at the market's official closing price
- The difference between the value at the closing price and the original value, must be paid to / or will be received from the clearing house by the clearing member as variation margin.
- You'll receive margin calls on valuation of your account following this process by 10am the next day
- It is a zero sum with one trader's profits netting the other's losses on marking to market of all individual positions on a daily basis.
- Done via LCH Clearnet Protected Payments System PPS
- example below
- Ticks
- A tick is the minimum price movement on the contract as defined by the exchange and can vary from contract to contract

- Uses of futures
- Financial Futures may be used in risk management strategies to protect the capital value of equity and fixed interest portfolios in a rising interest rate environment. In a similar way, yields on short-term investments can be protected during periods of falling interest rates
- 3 main
- hedging
- A hedge is a temporary substitute for a known future requirement. Essentially it involves taking a futures position that is equal and opposite to an existing or anticipated position in the cash market.
- trading
- Trading is buying and selling futures with the aim of making a profit. It allows an investor to take a view on the cash market's direction without having to buy or sell the underlying financial instrument.
- adds liquidity to the market bc of volume of traders<br>
- arbitrage

if you are the fixed rate payer, you pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate
if you are the fixed rate receiver, (BY DEDUCTION) you are paying the floating rate and are the floating rate payerCIRS = Currency and Interest rate swapsNot taking notes on theory, just on calculationsClearing House which stands as buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer.As an example a market maker when asked for a price in a 3 month EUR Call/USD Put (American style) with a strike price of 1.6500 might quote 10 - 10 ¼ p.c. This is his estimate of what implied volatility will be over the option time to expiry. The market user then decides whether this is in line with or differs from his own view. If the market user believes volatility will be lower he sells (volatility) to the market 351 maker’s bid of 10 p.c. If he believes volatility will be higher than 10 ¼ p.c. he buys (volatility). Once this has been agreed the buyer of volatility is the buyer of the option and the Premium is then calculated using all data elements now available. On agreement of the transaction the Premium is then payable (on deal date) by the buyer to the seller.Price may be in another currency even if it's EUR call / USD putBreak even:
For the holder of a Call this is the strike price plus premium paid (points in rate). For the holder of a Put this is the Strike price less the premium paid (points in rate).An ITM option will ALWAYS be exercised. An OTM option will not be exercised and is described as expiring “worthless”. On exercise an OTC Currency option becomes a standard Spot foreign exchange transaction between the two parties and is then subject to routine credit risk concerns (i.e. delivery risk).For example, if a change of 1 percent in the exchange rate causes the currency option premium to change by 0.5 percent then the delta is described as being 0.5The Delta represents the speed with which an option price will change relative to the underlying. It gives an idea of the probability that the option will be In-the- money at expiry. It can be described as the option’s “pay-off”.Delta is a ratio between 0-1

Options with a high Gamma ratio will be attractive to option buyers, but less attractive to option sellers. High Gammas mean fast, accelerating changes in Delta, thus options going in-the-money accelerate sellers’ losses and purchasers’ gains.Options with a high Gamma ratio will be attractive to option buyers, but less attractive to option sellers.

sell and buy to match delta ratio
Call is at 10 million to get delta ratio of 0.5 he buys 5 million
goes up to 0.7 so buys 2million to get to 7 million
goes down to 0.5 so he sells the 2 million (going up and going down is the exchange rate in the market (St))
We multiply these cashflows by the exchange rates
so when he bought the extra 2million to get to 7 million at the exchange rate (2 million USD for 1.5600 EUR = USD 3,120,00). Then he sold it at the lower exchange rate when the delta went back down to 0.5 (2 million USD for 1.5500 EUR = USD 3,100,00 is what he got back when he paid 20,000USD more)

external events come back and make proper notes laterA long (overbought) position in a currency which rises against the comparator currency will result in a profit, whereas a short position in such a currency will result in a loss. This is the risk and there are limits used in a bank to control and monitor this risk. Market Risk (market by market and product by product) FX risk transaction exposure For example a UK exporter invoicing in foreign currency and being paid by his customers abroad in foreign currency has an exchange risk against local currency (GBP) with every export order (transaction) he fills and for which he issues an invoice. The company has three choices: to cover (sell) the risk – by dealing with a bank in the traditional foreign exchange cash market,
to hedge (insure against) the risk – by using treasury derivatives such as currency options
or to run the risk. Provided the risk has been identified and the management are happy then running the risk can be considered a risk management decision. translation exposure reported as one currency in the balance sheet but different elsewhere Economic exposure Economic risk may be mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange or Currency options hedging strategies.
May arise when dealing with countries with different interest rates or exchanges and have your competitors in different countries using different exchange rates MR - Cash foreign exchange instruments financial institution exchange exposure
Market risk position limits
central bank limits / in-bank limits banks limited by central bank
referred to as Overnight Open Exchange Position Limit
Managed by Risk Management Department exchange risk Comes from "Open Exchange Positions" and fact that exchanges fluctuate
definition: The open exchange position can be defined as the difference between total assets and total liabilities, regardless of value date, in any currency, or pair of, or group of currencies. Here the bank will include assets and liabilities which are not all dealer initiated, i.e. interest accrual positions in foreign currencies
Long (overbought) position in a currency which rises against the comparator currency will result in a profit, whereas a short position in such a currency will result in a loss. This is the risk and there are limits used in a bank to control and monitor this risk. open exchange position limits intra-day limits "daylight" positions
limits positions during the day
can be multiple of Overnight limit overnight position limits "close of day" Depends on: on balance sheet,
local market size, business involvement,
risk management policies,
dealers’ experience etc. Limits may be expressed as being on "net short basis" the sum of all short currency positions (this is to avoid double counting) Controlled by treasury division FO, MO, BO reconciliation of overnight positions BO responsibility to ensure all risk positions are reconciled: Dealer's records to "Books of Account" and or other management info returns on daily basis time zone risk FX market on 24h basis
differences between the different markets opening and closing at different times position passing / stop loss / take profit orders MR - Forward Foreign exchange - Interest Rate risk Forward foreign exchange trading is effectively trading interest rate differential “off the balance sheet”.
MR Position limits - Forward foreign exchange
Interest rate risk is the same as or equal to the interest rate differentials between the 2 currencies involved. It comes as a result from the maintenance of the mismatch (gaps) of maturity positions of cash market spot against forward purchases and sales. Such as for foreign currency pairs and off-balance sheet derivative products like n-d-fs and all are effective on a forward/forward basis.
It's measured per currency pair, per currency and on a consolidated basis with spot exchange positions and interest arbitrage operations included such as money market balancing items in the Mismatch (Gap) reporting where deemed appropriate.
Another good approach is to use a similar one to money market interest rate risk MR - FICC Derivatives (Exchange traded Currency Options) market risk comes from the underlying exchange rate or interest rate having volatility which fluctuates due to adverse market conditions
with options, Buyers: the potential loss is limited to the premium and the upside is (potentially) unlimited
Sellers (writers): the potential loss is unlimited and the profit is limited to the premium (margin) long/overbought call (put) on a commodity/currency/IR where option price (premium/margin) rises will result in a profit (loss) MR - FICC Derivatives (OTC Currency / interest rate options) same risk with positions like described above
hedging method = delta hedging for sold/written options using a computed model which looks at the proportion of cover in the underlying (be it cash or security) market required given your current position in the market and also looking at trends. But these hedging methods in themselves also give risk to further risks (both credit and market risks) in those underlying markets
Trading limits help with this both on trading and on hedging positions MR - Commodities (Precious Metals) commodity risk definition: relates to commodity prices (Precious metals, corn, copper, crude oil etc.) main risk is that their implied vol will change positions can be controlled in similar way to FX position risk MR - Cash Money Market and financial instruments main risk in CMM is interest rate risk: is that the dealer has a short (overlent) position in the fixed periods and interest rates rise or the dealer has a long (overborrowed) position in the fixed periods and interest rates fall
Overall market risk (interest rate risk) is defined and managed by the allocation of Mismatch (Gap) limits
It happens for unmatched/uncovered positions in financial instruments from CH5: Treasury Bills
Bankers Acceptances (BAs)
Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
Commercial Papers (CP) Again trading limits on positions help MR - FICC Derivatives (Short term Interest rate) MR - FRA's similar to open exchange positions
market risk depends on price vol of currency being traded
hedging or trading bases can either create or cover IR risk
When hedging FRAs if off-balance sheet derivatives then it must be consolidated into the cash market reporting so it can be used to assess overall interest rate risk
They don't offset liquidity risk
Considered Contract for difference calculated on settlement date (fixing date) Re-investment risk in that the settlement rate being used as the discount rate may not be achieved on re-investment
trading limits again MR - Financial Futures transactions can be effected as trading positions and are subject to MR like open exchange positions.
Degree depends on price vol of underlying.
Risks are reflected in initial margin requirements
Can be used for hedging or trading
If hedging, it is off-balance sheet and must be included in cash market report to assess overall IR risk
Trading limits again MR - Longer-term IRS (but including OIS) MR when swaps are unmatched (warehoused) by traders awaiting the fixed payer client having already closed a swap with a fixed receiver. Exposed to underlying long term bond or markets
also swap spreads quoted in interbank market
risk is only gone once the unmatched position has been closed as exactly matched (payment flow dates)
Due to nature usually imperfectly matched
Can use duration analysis like for bonds Other IR risk from mismatched maturity positions of cash market assets, libabilities and off-balance sheet derivative products as well as outstanding commitments to lend or borrow (forward/forward) at agreed fixed interest rates basically you're at risk when you've fixed something at an interest rate The interest variation date of variable interest rate operations (e.g. at 2 days notice or at “Prime rate”) must be regarded as the next business day when a change may occur.
can evaluate positions by comparing historic (break even) and current MtM rates of interest either from today (i.e. spot) or on a forward/forward basis.
P&amp;L can be evaluated on accrual basis then discounted back to today's value using normal NPV techniques
Can also use a "What-if" report
Mismatch limits limits put in place to limit their ability to create mismatch positions
The limits can be an absolute maximum amount which must not be exceeded within a pre-agreed time horizon (frequently one year) or can be controlled by a maximum cumulative total of all mismatch positions which must not occur later than a date linked to the liquidity of the currency market involved or profitability or some other measure. Credit Risk (Market by market and product by product) CR - Spot foreign exchange Delivery risk (Herstatt risk) Foreign exchange market = cash market
on value date, currencies involved must be physically delivered as agreed upon as per the contract
If the bank doesn't receive the currency in the contract and has already paid the countervalue (the other side of the currency be it the foreign one or the local one) then the risk is 100% of what was already paid away
It's a daily risk assessment of both spot and forward outstandings
The risk department limits with with a single metric -&gt; "delivery risk limit" when it creates counterparty credit limits
delivery risk may also arise due to middle eastern markets due to differing Islamic weekend/holiday dates
bilateral netting and CLS reduce impact of this risk
payment netting reduces settlement risk f counterparties are to exchange multiple cash on any value date, they can agree to net those cash flows to one payment per currency. Not only does such payment netting reduce settlement risk, it also economises on processing procedures. CR - Forward foreign exchange Cash market
also subject to Delivery risk If, in a non CLS currency or a transaction with a non CLS counterparty, for some reason the bank does not receive the currency contracted to be purchased and has already paid away the countervalue in local or another foreign currency then the risk is 100% of the sums so paid away. Market replacement risk additional Credit risk in forward foreign exchange
this is where if like in credit risk, a counterparty defaults, not only on top of that but now to replace their positions you're also subject to changes in interest rates and exchange rates
A transaction is only completed by the receiver in Mega Bank if it results in a profit against replacement at the current market rate. If the transaction results in a profit to Major Bank (Loss to the receiver) this contract will more than likely NOT be completed. If the transaction results in a profit to the receiver this contract will be completed – this is assessed as “zero” risk. This process is referred to in legal terms as specific performance or “cherry picking” and results in asymmetric risk.
you basically look at the exchange rates in the contract and see whether doing it in the market would be more favourable or not
if it's less favourable, you're subject to market replacement risk (they offered you a lower rate, or a higher rate) and that difference is then your market replacement risk CR mitigation techniques Foreign Exchange FX
netting reduces credit exposure and processing and payment costs
These netting arrangements only apply to foreign exchange transactions in the same currency pairings dealt for the same value date and the terms of all such netting are agreed bilaterally between the banks.
helps with market replacement risk (see above)
This risk does not disappear if default of the counterparty means a potential “profit” i.e. a better rate than contractually agreed is then available. The concept of “specific performance” with the receiver in bankruptcy being able to decide which contracts to complete means that transactions resulting in a profit to the defaulting party would be completed and those resulting in a loss would be allowed to fail. Netting by novation is one way to reduce this market replacement risk.
Close-out netting Reduces pre-settlement risk
negates "cherry picking" CLS Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) is an industry initiative to reduce the risks associated with cross-currency transactions. These risks have been principally caused by delays due to time-zone differences. CLS is a real-time system that enables simultaneous settlement globally, irrespective of time zones, within a five-hour timeframe in Europe.

other members handle all instructions Each day members submit instructions (like SSI's) to CLS bank All Members input and manage their instructions. Settlement Members make their payments to CLS Bank, and monitor their settlement and account positions. Members receive real-time operational information and manage their own data.
CLS Bank reduces the risk of a Member losing the principal relating to an FX transaction from paying away one currency and failing to receive the countercurrency. Unlike the Futures Markets clearing houses CLS Bank does not guarantee the settlement of every instruction that is submitted for settlement, nor provide protection against the failure of forward trades nor become a counterparty to any underlying cross-currency transaction, however, once an instruction is settled, CLS Bank ensures that each Member will receive the payment to which it is entitled from CLS Bank in accordance with its rules and risk management procedures. Benefits achieved through STP, improving credit management and liquidity consolidation
also improves the availability and flow of funds
How it works Copy of MT300 FX confirmation within 2 hours of deal being struck, transaction is to be settled via CLS by both banks directly to the CLS bank
CLS Bank issues the net amounts owed by the member and the members manage their own instructions and update their accounts and make payments to the CLS bank, monitoring their settlement and account positions. They get real-time data for this.

MT300 FX SWIFT confirmations are transmitted to CLS Bank on deal date
In case where one party fails, the party who does pay will get their counter currency payment but the other party will get nothing and this is facilitated because CLS bank has ties to central banks which have reserves in major currencies Inside/Outside Swaps another service provided by CLS
An I/O Swap comprises two equal and opposite FX transactions that are agreed as an intraday swap. This reduces intraday cash flows while leaving the institution's overall FX position unchanged. I/O Swaps exploit the likelihood that an institution with a large short position in-CLS will almost certainly have one or more large long positions in-CLS.
can match liquidity flows to domestic needs as well as to CLS system
Currencies = G20's ISO (SWIFT) currency codes CR (and Counterparty Dealing Limits) - Money Market The credit risk in Money market Cash transactions is relatively easy to identify. If you have lent unsecured money the risk is that the counterparty will go bankrupt before maturity date and you will not receive back the amount of your advance.
Loans The credit risk is in the name of the borrower of cash. CR (and Counterparty Dealing Limits) - Financial Instruments Repos The credit risk is on the issuer of the collateral (typically government securities therefore typically lower risk than comparator commercial collateral transactions). T-Bills The credit risk is in the name of the government issuer (typically lower risk than comparator commercial issues). Eligible Bills / Bankers Acceptances The credit risk is in the name of the Acceptor (guarantor) CDs Purchased at Issue The credit risk is in the name of the issuer of the CD. Secondary CDs purchased The credit risk is in the name of the issuer of the CD. In certain financial centres where physical settlement of such instruments takes place, there is also a delivery risk in the name of the seller of the CD between the date of payment and receipt of the financial instrument purchased. Commercial Paper The credit risk is in the name of the issuing company i.e. Commercial risk or, in some countries, financial institution. Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) There are currently around 30 central securities depositories (CSD) in the European Union. Euroclear (Belgium) and Clearstream (Luxembourg) act as depositories for international securities and have their own account in most CSDs in Europe and beyond. These entities are referred to as CCPs (Central Clearing Counterparties) within the Basel rules. In all transactions which involve exchanging cash for security/collateral you're subjected to delivery risk (daylight or intra-day) on purchases. Between payment and confirmation
between clearing houses
between instructions through agents
from confirmation of receipt of cash in payment CR - FICC Derivatives FRAs Market replacement risk
Due to counterparty credit risk (counterparty defaults/fails before settlement) i) a market replacement cost, a substitute FRA arranged at an unfavourable rate judged against the original transaction.
ii) if a replacement FRA cannot be arranged, full exposure to any adverse movements in interest rates against which the original FRA was initiated. relates to vol of IR in cash market assessed daily on MtM basis
(a negative market to market, i.e. the bank owes the counterparty = nil risk). Some banks may still assess risk on FRAs as a flat percentage (i.e. 5% maximum potential interest rate swing in any period where there is an FRA outstanding). Financial Futures (STIR contracts) NO CREDIT RISK This is because of the Exchange of Clearing House Where the CH becomes buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer Because of the total lack of credit risk, Financial Futures are the only financial trading product which is not subject to Capital Adequacy requirements. IRS (including OIS) Have credit risk on the counterparty, reflects market replacement risk (and costs associated)
Market replacement risk If the counterparty defaults during life of the swap, the bank will be left with their position which may be covered at a loss. Position could be in foreign exchange positions or interest rate positions
Swaps should be MtM on regular basis to reflect market replacement risk and effected preferably daily.
Counterparties aren't usually aware of each other's identities bank assumes credit risk of each counterparty unless acts as just a broker Given the long term nature of swaps banks must pay greater attention to increased risk the longer the period remaining to maturity of any transaction. Many banks use a sliding scale to assess credit risk on swaps based on historic analysis of movements in interest rates. Further percentage credit utilisation measures may be applied where the currenc(ies) involved are not traded in the major international markets.
Currency and IR swaps are subject to exchange rate volatility which can lead to a higher replacement cost on default
Factors affecting credit risk Overall level of interest rates
Collateral
Reset frequency more frequent, easy to identify if counterparty will default Shape of yield curve if currently positive then the probability is that floating rates will rise meaning that the floating rate payer (fixed rate receiver)’s liability will increase in the future. Delivery risk - IRS risks rise when: i) dates of receipts and payments of fixed and floating interest flows may differ and the counterparty fails to make a payment after receiving funds from the bank
ii) a counterparty accepts payment to it but fails to make payment to the bank on the same day. This risk applies mainly to currency swaps since payments in the same currency on an interest rate swap are usually netted.
iii) in respect of currency swaps, the final exchange of currencies at an exchange rate agreed several years previously could lead to substantial exchange exposure CR Mitigation Some ways are netting and collateral otherwise credit derivatives Credit Derivatives A credit derivative is another means of credit mitigation allowing the lender to effectively transfer risk of a debtor defaulting to a third party. This third party, as in insurance policy accepts some or all the risk in return for payment, known as the premium.
CDS definition: A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial derivative whereby an investor "swaps" or offsets his credit risk in a bilateral OTC contract with another investor. If lender is concerned their counterparty will default, they can enter a CDS with someone else (transferring the credit risk to an insurer at a premium)
The lender buys a CDS from 3rd party who then agrees to reimburse the lender should their counterparty (borrower) default
Different parties: Lender/Borrower
Buyer/Seller
The Lender (A) of the security/loan/etc. is the one at risk to the borrower (B) (counterparty) and would be the one to buy the CDS (therefore be the buyer)
the Seller (C) is therefore the 3rd party and the insurer
A = Lender and Buyer
B = Borrower
C = Seller and Insurer
A buys CDS from C to protect from B defaulting TRS A Total return swap is a swap which permits a counterparty (receiver) to achieve the risk and return on an asset without actually owning it. In exchange this party must pay an agreed rate (fixed, floating or variable) over the life of the swap. The receiver assumes the credit risk, whereas the payer takes on the credit exposure the receiver may be subject to. An example is USD floating rate v. S&amp;P 500 index on an agreed investment amount.

CVA is the market value of counterparty credit risk. Documentation Cash Markets (i.e. FX and MM) have "My word is my bond" don't have enough documentation. So in last few years have gathered standard terms and conditions governing each of these instruments especially with rise of derivatives in OTC markets FXC cover close-out netting provisions and transaction payments legal terms

Covers all rates market derivative products.
2 types: local Multi-currency cross-border A Credit Support Annex is a legal document which regulates the collateral used in Derivative transactions. It is one of the four parts that make up an ISDA Master Agreement but is not mandatory. ISDA Credit Support Annex (CSA) defines terms under which collateral is posted / transferred between swap counterparties to mitigate credit risk coming from "in the money" derivative positions
If on any Valuation Date, the Delivery Amount equals or exceeds the Pledgor's Minimum Transfer Amount, the Pledgor must transfer Eligible Collateral with a Value at least equal to the Delivery Amount. The Delivery Amount is the amount the Credit Support Amount exceeds the Value of all posted Collateral held by the Secured Party. The Collateral must meet the Eligibility criteria in the agreement, e.g., which currencies it may be in, what types of bonds are allowed, and which, if any, haircuts are applied. There are also rules for the settlement of disputes arising over valuation of derivative positions.
To distinguish between the Schedule to the Master Agreement and the Credit Support Annex, the schedules are numbered as Parts and CSA are numbered as Paragraphs.
Under English Law, CSA are considered transactions: Any collateral listed as ‘Eligible Collateral’ is delivered as an outright transfer of title. The collateral taker becomes the outright owner of that collateral free of any third party interest.
An English law credit support annex operates by way of outright transfers of title to the posted collateral whereas parties transacting business under a New York CSA can materially change the parties’ rights and obligations and their standing upon an insolvency of the other party giving rise to Legal risk. (See later in this chapter). Operational Risk Definition In 2004 the Basel Committee initially defined Operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. The committee indicates that this definition excludes systemic risk, legal risk and reputational risk
After downfall of big companies regulators decided to focus on risks other than Credit Risk and Market Risk Includes: employee errors, (e.g. fat-finger trading errors, reconciliation failings)
model mis-use or mal-functions, (e.g. incorrect or erroneously programmed algorithms)
communication failures, (e.g. telephone, lack of rates information, trading platform outages etc.)
IT systems failures, (e.g. in-house systems problems - processing and/or reporting)
fire, floods or other losses to physical assets,
fraud or other criminal activity (including rogue trading) Legal Risk Legal risk is risk from uncertainty due to legal actions or uncertainty in the applicability or interpretation of contracts, laws or regulations. Depending on an institution's circumstances, legal risk may entail such issues as Contract formation i.e. what constitutes a legitimate contract? Is an oral agreement sufficient, or must there be a legal document? What documentation is required? Does a counterparty have the capacity to enter into a transaction?
If transacting across borders, subject to more jurisdictions and risk on who becomes the authority over a legal issue Reputational Risk Based on trust

Loss of confidence by any group of market counterparties can quickly lead to the decline of a bank with credit lines reduced or withdrawn making the bank’s funding more difficult or more expensive.
Reputational risk management is supported by "the plans, processes and practices, which engender and sustain the trust of all and each category of market counterparties". Other risks Specific Risk ("unsystematic risk") In a balanced portfolio of assets there'd be a spread between general market risk and risks specific to individual components of that portfolio. Determination of the extent of exposure to individual risks is made using models such as Treynor-Black in which the optimal share of a security is inversely proportional to the square of its specific risk. Systemic Risk Systemic risk is a means to describe the likelihood of the collapse of a financial system, such as a general stock market crash or a joint breakdown of the banking system.
Systemic risk != systematic risk Systematic risk = whole economy like business cycles or wars SIFI Systematically Important Financial Institution bank/insurance company or fin institution which failure might cause a crisis
"too big to fail" Wrong way risk defined by ISDA as the risk that occurs when "exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty
When default risk and credit exposure increase together
Ordinarily in trading book credit risk measurement, the creditworthiness of the counterparty and the exposure of a transaction are measured and modelled independently. An example of wrong way risk is where credit derivatives are being used to protect against counterparty default the counterparty’s subsequent default impacts the creditworthiness of the seller of the credit insurance (derivative). Basel Accords (Basel I to Basel III) Basel I is a set of international banking regulations put forward by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision that sets out the minimum capital requirements of financial institutions with the goal of minimizing credit risk
G10 got together
Started with Cooke Ratio
Together are called "Basel Accords"
Basel III recommendations were originally scheduled to be introduced from 2013 until 2015; however, implementation was extended repeatedly to 31st March 2019 and then again until 1st January 2022.
Tiers Tier 1 Tier 1 Capital (“core” capital) consists of equity and disclosed reserves.
Secure capital to absorb losses in case of defaults so it gets absorbed by the reserve instead of earnings Tier 2 Tier 2 Capital (“supplementary” capital) includes perpetual securities, undisclosed reserves, subordinated debt over 5 years to maturity and shares redeemable at the option of the issuer. BIS ratio Of the BIS Ratio for Capital cover of 8 percent at least 50 percent must be Tier 1 Capital. All classes of assets are risk weighted according to asset classes and counterparty (OECD government to non-OECD non financial counterparty). As the perceived credit risk increases so too does the risk weighting. Trading Book 3 criteria: that the instrument is a financial instrument
…and that the instrument is held for trading purposes
…or that the instrument is hedging an exposure in the trading book. Instruments included: transferable securities,
money market instruments,
financial futures contracts,
FRAs,
interest rate swaps,
currency swaps
and options to acquire these instruments. Definition: proprietary positions in financial instruments which are held for resale and/or which are taken on by the institution with the intention of benefiting in the short term from actual and/or expected differences between their buying and selling prices or positions taken in order to hedge other elements of the trading book
exposures due to the unsettled transactions, free deliveries and OTC derivative instruments, exposures due to repurchase agreements (Repos) and securities lending
those exposures in the form of fees, commission, interest, dividends and margin on exchange traded derivatives In the UK, positions are considered to be held with a trading intent if:.. they are marked to market daily as part of the internal risk management process - the position takers have autonomy in entering into transactions within predetermined limits
they satisfy any other criteria which the bank applies to the composition of its trading book on a consistent basis. CAD II CAD II is the EU directive that allows financial institutions to use internal VaR models to calculate market risk capital requirements in line with BIS Basel standards. Banks must measure Delta, Gamma and Vega risk when calculating Capital adequacy required against written (Sold) Options positions. VAR is an acceptable measure of risk for assessment of BIS capital adequacy calculations and other central bank imposed risk measures.

Lays down basic standards for in-house (IM) models The model must express a VaR estimate to a 99% confidence level, must calculate losses on the basis of a 10 day holding period and all historic data used must cover at least the last 12 months Basel II differences Brought in 3 pillars
more reflective of underlying risks in banking.
Better incentives
Built on the previous one to point to risks that banks actually face This was achieved in part by aligning capital requirements more closely to the risk of credit loss and by introducing a new capital charge for exposures to the risk of loss caused by operational failures. Pillars Summary: Pillar I -&gt; Minimum Capital Requirements
Pillar II -&gt; Supervisory Review
Pillar III -&gt; Market Discipline Pillar I - Minimum capital requirements Pillar I presents the calculation of the total minimum capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk
The capital ratio is calculated using the definition of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets. The total capital ratio must be no lower than 8%. Tier 2 capital is limited to 100% of Tier 1 capital.
Definition of "Eligible Capital" is still the same as Basel I
Under the standardised approach to credit risk, general provisions can be included in Tier 2 capital subject to the limit of 1.25% of risk weighted assets. Under the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, the treatment of the 1988 Accord to include general provisions (or general loan-loss reserves) in Tier 2 capital is withdrawn. The definition of Tier 3 capital as set out in the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (January 1996, modified September 1997, in this Framework referred to as the Market Risk Amendment) remains unchanged. Basel III Basel III, the global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk agreed upon by members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2010 was developed in response to the deficiencies in financial regulation revealed by the 2008 financial crisis. Basel III strengthens bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage.
Definitions and calculations: B III - Pillar 1: aligns minimum capital requirements more closely to each bank's actual risk of economic loss
Risk-weighted assets under Basel II / III Total risk-weighted assets under Basel II are determined by multiplying the capital requirements for market risk and operational risk by 12.5 (i.e. the reciprocal of the minimum capital ratio of 8%) and adding the resulting figures to the sum of risk-weighted assets for credit risk. Pillar II - Supervisory Review Pillar II covers the key principles of supervisory review, risk management, guidance and supervisory transparency and accountability produced by BIS with respect to banking risks, including guidance relating to, among other things, the treatment of interest rate risk in the banking book, credit risk (stress testing, definition of default, residual risk, and credit concentration risk), operational risk, enhanced cross-border communication and cooperation, and securitisation
Ensures banks are better developing and using better risk management techniques to monitor and manage their risks
Supervisors must evaluate how banks are assessing their capital based on their needs and risks and must know when to intervene
can't just rely on capital reserves, also need internal risk limits and controls
There are three main areas that might be particularly suited to treatment under Pillar II, risks considered under Pillar I that are not fully captured by the Pillar I process (e.g. credit concentration risk); those factors not taken into account by the Pillar I process (e.g. interest rate risk in the banking book, business and strategic risk); and factors external to the bank (e.g. business cycle effects).
A further important aspect of Pillar II is the assessment of compliance with the minimum standards and disclosure requirements of the more advanced methods in Pillar I, in particular the IRB framework for credit risk and the Advanced Measurement Approaches for operational risk.
Supervisors must ensure that these requirements are met, both as qualifying criteria and on a continuing basis.
Under Basel III - Pillar II bank supervisors must evaluate the activities and risk profiles of individual banks to determine whether those organisations should hold higher levels of capital than the minimum requirements in Pillar 1 would specify and to see whether there is any need for remedial actions. Pillar III - Market Discipline The rationale for Pillar III is sufficiently strong to warrant the introduction of disclosure requirements for banks using the Framework. Supervisors have an array of measures that they can use to require banks to make such disclosures. Some of these disclosures will be qualifying criteria for the use of particular methodologies or the recognition of particular instruments and transactions
Complements Pillar I and Pillar II
encourages market discipline with disclosure requirements
allows market participants to assess key pieces of information on: the scope of application
capital
risk exposures
risk assessment processes
and hence the capital adequacy of the institution BIS believes it's an effective way of getting each bank to inform the market of their exposure to those risks and allows for transparency and comparability
Basel III, Pillar 3 leverages the ability of market discipline to motivate prudent management by enhancing the degree of transparency in banks’ public reporting to shareholders and customers. Probability of Default (PD) Probability of default (PD) is the likelihood of a default over a particular time horizon.
Under Basel II: a default event on a debt obligation is said to have occurred if... it is unlikely that the obligor will be able to repay its debt to the bank without giving up any pledged collateral
the obligor is more than 90 days past due on a material credit obligation The PD is an estimate of the likelihood that the default event will occur over a fixed assessment horizon, usually taken to be one year. The PD can be estimated for a particular obligor which is the usual practice in wholesale banking, or for a segment of obligors sharing similar credit risk characteristics which is the usual practice in retail banking. Exposure at Default (EAD) Exposure at Default is an estimate of the extent to which a bank may be exposed to a counterparty in the event of, and at the time of, that counterparty’s default. EAD is equal to the current amount outstanding in case of fixed exposures like term loans. For revolving exposures like lines of credit, EAD can be divided into drawn and undrawn commitments.
Based on Basel II: EAD measures the amount that is likely to be drawn further if a default occurs.
2 terms for this are used (how expressed): Conversion Factor (CF)
Loan Equivalent (LEQ) While under foundation approach (F-IRB) calculation of EAD is guided by the regulators, under the advanced approach (A-IRB) banks enjoy greater flexibility on how they calculate EAD.
Calculation Under Foundation Approach (F-IRB) Under F-IRB EAD is calculated taking account of the underlying asset, forward valuation, facility type and commitment details. This value does not take account of guarantees, collateral or security (i.e. it ignores Credit Risk mitigation techniques with the exception of on-balance sheet netting where the effect of netting is included in Exposure at Default).
For on-balance sheet transactions, EAD is identical to the nominal amount of exposure. On-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits of a bank to a corporate counterparty is permitted to reduce the estimate of EAD under certain conditions.
For off-balance sheet items, there are two broad types which the IRB approach needs to address: transactions with uncertain future drawdown, such as commitments and revolving credits, and OTC foreign exchange, interest rate and equity derivative contracts Calculation Under Advanced Approach (A-IRB) Under A-IRB, the bank itself determines the appropriate EAD to be applied to each exposure.
(Internal EAD estimates)
A bank using internal EAD estimates for capital purposes is able to differentiate EAD values on the basis of a wider set of transaction characteristics (e.g. product type) as well as borrower characteristics. These values would be expected to represent a conservative view of long-run averages, although banks are free to use more conservative estimates.
A bank wishing to use its own estimates of EAD will need to demonstrate to its local Central Bank / regulator that it can meet additional minimum requirements pertinent to the integrity and reliability of these estimates.
All estimates of EAD are calculated net of any specific provisions a bank may have raised against an exposure. Loss given default (LGD) Definition: Loss Given Default is percentage of loss over the total exposure when bank's counterparty goes to default
It is facility-specific because such losses are generally understood to be influenced by key transaction characteristics: such as the presence of collateral
and the degree of subordination. Theoretically, LGD is calculated in different ways, 'Gross' LGD, the favourite with academics, where total losses are divided by exposure at default (EAD)
or ‘Blanco’ LGD, preferred by banks because they have many secured facilities and would like to decompose their losses between losses on unsecured portions and losses on secured portions due to depreciation of collateral quality. Capital Treatment of Credit Risk under Basel II and III 3 approaches to credit risk under BII. The SA is simplest of the 3. The other 2 are based on internal ratings (IM)
Standardised Approach SA avoids complexity
Risk Weights Risk weighted assets under the Standardised Approach will continue to be calculated as the product of the amount of exposures and supervisory determined risk weight
As in the current Accord the risk weights will be determined by the category of the borrower, sovereign bank or corporate counterparty. There is now no distinction on the sovereign risk weighting depending on whether or not the sovereign is a member of OECD under Basel III. Basel III - Summary of changes from previous versions (earlier Accords) Minimum common equity requirement of 2% to 4.5%
Capital conservation buffer 2.5% - met with common equity. If under then there are greater constraints on earnings distributions are imposed
Total common equity requirement is 7%
Higher capital requirements for trading, derivatives and securitization
Tier 1 capital from 4% to 6% over the same period
Countercyclical buffer in the range of 0 to 2.5% of common equity according to national circumstances
Introduction of Liquidity coverage ratio (LCD)
Introduction of Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)
Supplemented by non risk based leverage ratio Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) The purpose of the ICAAP document is to inform the Board of an institution of the ongoing assessment of the firm’s risks, how the firm intends to mitigate those risks and how much current and future capital is necessary having considered other mitigating factors. The ICAAP document is also how the firm explains to the UK’s PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority) or its local regulator its internal capital adequacy assessment process. Foundation internal ratings-based (F-IRB) F stands for "Foundation" so F-IRB foundation internal ratings-based approach.

- Under Basel III
- Ensures bank holds enough liquid assets to cover short term crisis
- based on predetermined set of cash inflows and outflows
- Pillar I ratio
- Must cover 30 stressed period and liquid assets in respect for lending must be available for drawdown within 30 d period.
- 2 Categories of liquid assets [Level 1 &amp; Level 2]
- Level 1
- 100% of Qualifying marketable securities from sovereigns, central banks, public sector entities and multilateral development banks.
- 100 % of Qualifying central bank reserves
- 100 % of Domestic sovereign or central bank debt in domestic currency
- 100 % of Domestic sovereign debt for non-0% risk weighted sovereigns, issued in foreign currency
- Level 2
- 85% of Sovereign, central bank, and PSE assets qualifying for 20% risk weighting
- 85% of Qualifying corporate bonds rated AA- or higher
- 85% of Qualifying covered bonds rated AA- or higher
- Both Level 1 and Level 2 assets should “ideally” also be eligible for intraday or overnight liquidity facilities at central banks.
- Level 2 assets have a specific quantitative benchmark to prove they are reliable during stressed conditions - a maximum price decline (or increase in haircut) over a stressed 30 day period not exceeding 10%.
- Note: Assets and Liabilities are assessed for the purpose of the LCR currency by currency. For example Sterling liabilities need to be supported by Sterling assets.

Hedging Financial instruments which can be used to hedge interest rate risk have already been discussed at length in Topic 4. For short term interest rate risk management the dealers can use Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) or Short term interest rate (STIR) Financial futures contracts. For longer term rate risk management instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency and interest rate swaps, Caps, Floors and Collars (interest rate options) together with Bond Futures. P&amp;L Procedures Interest rate risk The interest variation date of variable interest rate operations (e.g. at 2 days notice or at “Prime rate”) must be regarded as the next business day when a change may occur.

What Treasury Does — always have cash when/where needed What it means: Make sure the bank can pay everything due today and tomorrow: client withdrawals,
settlements,
payroll,
margin calls,
taxes. How it works: Keep a rolling cash-flow ladder (morning/noon/close; T+0 to T+7), maintain a buffer,
and line up borrowing/investing to cover dips. Example
<img alt="Pasted image 20250923100500.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250923100500.png" target="_self"> — pick the right mix of money What it means: Decide how much to fund O/N vs term;
secured vs unsecured;
and when to issue CP/MTN. How it works: Blend for cost + resilience.
Short money is flexible but can reprice;
term money fixes cost;
secured money is cheaper but uses collateral. <br>Example
<img alt="Pasted image 20250923101342.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250923101342.png" target="_self"> — line up earnings vs funding when rates move What it means: The bank often lends long and borrows short. If rates jump, funding gets expensive before loan income catches up. How it works: Measure repricing gaps,
set limits,
and use interest-rate swaps (IRS)
so income and costs move together. <br>Example (NII Sensitivity)
<img alt="Pasted image 20250923101408.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250923101408.png" target="_self"> — get the right currency, not just cash What it means: Ensure money is in the right currency
and on time; manage net-open-position (NOP) limits. How it works: Use FX swaps/CCS to fund books,
and a roll calendar to avoid bunching. <br>Example (NOP + Roll)
<img alt="Pasted image 20250923101558.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250923101558.png" target="_self"> — turn assets into cheaper cash (and fees) What it means: Borrow cheaper by pledging high-quality collateral (repo) and earn fees by lending securities. How it works: Eligibility lists and haircuts define what can be pledged;
margining keeps exposure covered as prices move. <br>Example (Repo w/ Margin call)
<img alt="Pasted image 20250923101739.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250923101739.png" target="_self"> — make money actually move What it means: Ensure wires/settlements are on time
with clean controls. How it works: Maintain accurate SSIs,
watch cut-offs,
target high STP with clear repair workflows. <br>Example
<img alt="Pasted image 20250923101906.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250923101906.png" target="_self"> — set the internal price of money What it means: Business units pay/receive an internal rate so product pricing reflects the true cost of funds. How it works: For each currency/tenor publish FTP = reference curve + liquidity premium (and any policy spreads).
Charge at matched maturity. <br>Example
<img alt="Pasted image 20250923102250.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250923102250.png" target="_self"> — show the bank is liquid and safe What it means: Produce liquidity/encumbrance metrics e.g. LCR / NSFR and stress results on time, with reconciled data. How it works: Aggregate balances/cashflows,
apply rulebooks,
publish packs to management/regulators. <br>Example (LCR &amp; NSFR &amp; Emcumbrance)

(MU) Buy EUR 3m forward (outright) and sell EUR 6m forward (outright)
so use 3m offer and 6m bid = 3v6 fwd/fwd BID
MARKET USER WANTS TO SELL FORWARD SO USES MARKET MAKERS FUTURE BID
Market Maker bank covering fwd/fwd transaction (acting as market user covering transacting with his broker) LHS: BID At 21 sells spot EUR against USD
buys EUR back 3m fwd at 21 (EUR Premium) (BID) normal FX forward is how much you buy the base currency for forward ('points against') At 54 buys spot EUR against USD
sells EUR back 6m fwd at 54 (EUR Premium) (OFFER)
('points his favour')
normal FX forward offer is how much you sell base currency forward Net = 54 - 21 (buying) = 33 points dealers favour RHS: OFFER MU wants to sell EUR 3m and buy EUR 6m
BUYING FWD -&gt; 3v6 OFFER
So sells 3m fwd and buys 6m fwd
At 18: Buys spot EUR against USD
Sells EUR back 3m fwd at 18
(EUR premium) "points his favour" At 59 Sells spot EUR against USD
Buys EUR back 6m fwd at 59
(EUR Premium) "points against" Net = 59 - 18 (selling) = 41 points against him
Buying EUR 3v6 This is the most he will make therefore what he will quote (as a market maker)
therefore his BID and OFFER will be
33 - 41 (EUR Premium) The difference between the two forward rates is therefore the points differential dealt at on the forward/forward, namely 33 points EUR Premium (1.2809 minus 1.2776) <br><img alt="Pasted image 20250328102117.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250328102117.png" target="_self">

so they (MM) do a 2v3

MM buys at BID, so use BID spot rate
They originally bought EUR 10,000,000.00 at 0.80 00 = GBP 8,000,000.00
Now they will pay GBP 8,306,000.00 (MM BID on 31st May 202X (first leg of swap) MU is now entering swap to change position
In this example the original outright forward contract (Bank sells EUR) remains on the book but will eventually be off-set against the forward leg of the swap (Bank buys EUR) The EUR amounts will be compensated and the difference of GBP 320,000.00* (GBP 8,320,000.00 less 8,000,000.00) will be paid on this date by the market making bank to the corporate customer. The ‘all-in’ cost to the corporate customer buying EUR 10,000,000.00 on the earlier date of 31st May 202X is therefore GBP 7,986,000.00 (8,306,000.00 less 320,000.00) on 31st May 202X. Interest Arbitrage Interest arbitrage is the link between the Eurocurrency money markets via the forward exchange market
In such a currency, consider the situation where a bank dealer has quoted and dealt with a corporate customer on an outright basis and subsequently covered the currency exposure by a reverse spot operation. If there are no means available to cover the resultant forward exchange time position via a foreign exchange swap transaction, or exchange controls prohibit it, the mismatched currency cashflows can be squared by a liability in one and an asset in the other currency for the period in question. The initial spot and forward outright deals must in this case be identified together as a swap and treated as interest arbitrage.
e.g. dealer looking for funding of EUR asset by taking USD deposit uses the forward EUR/USD market in a 'covered' IR situation forward swap points are equivalent to difference in the interest rates in the two currencies concerned for the period quoted.

remember swap is simultaneous exchange of currencies (at spot/at fwd) so buys and sells EUR / sells and buys USD what you buy (EUR) will be the fixed amount. the counter currency amount (USD) is what changes based on the exchange rate. i.e. how many USD can you get for the EUR

YIELD CURVES: The shape of a yield curve is one of many pointers as to current market sentiment in respect of the anticipated level of future interest rates. Some textbooks will suggest that longer period rates are usually higher than short rates to allow for the time and inflation risks in longer term investment. But the shape of the money market yield curve up to 12 months at any time more significantly identifies the current market sentiment that over time interest rates are going to rise or fall
4 shapes:
Positive <img alt="Pasted image 20250128191615.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250128191615.png" target="_self">

interest rates are going to fall
if rates are decreasing, don't want to enter(borrow) into longer term maturities when at a later point you could get a cheaper interest rate. so you'd rather get short term maturities. more demand for short term money

Market risk is best measured as "value at risk" using probability analysis based upon a common confidence interval (e.g., two standard deviations) and time horizon (e.g., a one-day exposure).
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="G30_Summary.pdf > page=7&amp;selection=5,0,8,27" data-href="G30_Summary.pdf#page=7&amp;selection=5,0,8,27" href="resources/attachments/g30_summary.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">G30_Summary, page 7</a>
reducing market risks across derivatives to a single common denominator makes aggregation, comparison, and risk control easier. "Value at risk" is the expected loss from an adverse market movement with a specified probability over a particular period of time. For example, with 97.5% probability (that is, a "confidence interval" of 97.5%), corresponding to calculations using about two standard deviations, it can be determined that any change in portfolio value over one day resulting from an adverse market movement will not exceed a specific amount. Conversely, there is a 2.5% probability of experiencing an adverse change in excess of the calculated amount. Value at risk should encompass changes in all major market risk components listed in the recommendation. The difficulty in applying the technique of value at risk increases with the complexity of the risks being managed. For comparability, value at risk should be calculated to a common confidence interval and time horizon

Definition:
Market risk refers to the potential for losses arising from adverse movements in market variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, equity prices, or commodity prices.Examples:
Interest Rate Risk: A bondholder experiences losses when interest rates rise, as bond prices fall.
Currency Risk (FX Risk): A company with revenue in a foreign currency incurs losses when the home currency strengthens against the foreign currency.
Equity Risk: A portfolio of stocks decreases in value due to a market-wide downturn.
Definition:
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a counterparty's failure to meet its contractual obligations, such as failing to repay a loan or deliver securities.Examples:
Counterparty Risk: A bank suffers a loss when a borrower defaults on a loan.
Issuer Risk: An investor holding a corporate bond experiences losses when the issuing company defaults on interest payments.
Definition:
Liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to buy or sell assets quickly enough to prevent a loss or meet obligations due to inadequate market liquidity.Examples:
Market Liquidity Risk: An investor holding a large position in a thinly traded bond cannot sell it without significantly impacting its price.
Funding Liquidity Risk: A bank fails to meet its short-term obligations because it cannot raise funds quickly enough.
Definition:
Operational risk refers to the risk of loss due to failures in internal processes, systems, human errors, or external events.Examples:
System Failure: A trading platform crashes during a high-volume trading session.
Human Error: A trader mistakenly enters the wrong trade order, causing financial losses.
Fraud: An employee commits unauthorized transactions, resulting in reputational and financial harm.
Definition:
Settlement risk is the risk that one party in a transaction delivers their obligation (e.g., securities or cash), but the counterparty fails to deliver their side of the transaction.Examples:
Herstatt Risk: A bank delivers a currency in one time zone but does not receive the counter-currency from the counterparty in another time zone due to their default.
Definition:
Interest rate risk arises from changes in interest rates, which can impact the value of fixed-income instruments or interest-sensitive financial products.Examples:
A bank holding a portfolio of fixed-rate loans incurs losses when interest rates rise because the loans lose value.
Definition:
FX risk is the risk of losses arising from unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.Examples:
An exporter pricing goods in a foreign currency experiences reduced revenue if the foreign currency depreciates against the home currency.
Definition:
Basis risk is the risk that arises from the imperfect correlation between two related instruments or markets used in hedging.Examples:
A trader hedging an interest rate exposure with a futures contract on a similar but not identical bond faces losses due to the difference in price movements between the two instruments.
Definition:
Reputational risk refers to the potential loss of trust or reputation that can harm a firm’s client relationships and financial standing.Examples:
A bank accused of misconduct or fraud faces customer withdrawals, loss of business, and regulatory fines.
Definition:
Legal risk arises from unenforceable contracts, regulatory penalties, or litigation.Examples:
A financial institution executes a trade without properly adhering to the legal documentation, resulting in disputes or losses.
Definition:
Model risk occurs when financial models used for pricing, risk assessment, or decision-making are flawed or inaccurate.Examples:
A pricing model underestimates the risk of a complex derivative, leading to unexpected losses.
Definition:
Sovereign risk refers to the risk of a government defaulting on its debt obligations or imposing capital controls that restrict payments.Examples:
An investor holding bonds issued by a government faces losses when the government imposes foreign exchange restrictions or fails to make interest payments.
Definition:
Political risk is the potential for financial losses due to political instability, regulatory changes, or government actions.Examples:
An investment in a foreign country loses value after a government implements nationalization or expropriation policies.
Definition:
Regulatory risk is the risk of losses or operational disruption due to changes in laws, regulations, or supervisory requirements.Examples:
A bank incurs significant costs to comply with stricter capital requirements imposed by regulators.
Definition:
Inflation risk is the risk of purchasing power erosion due to rising prices.Examples:
An investor holding a bond with a fixed coupon rate experiences real returns that diminish when inflation rises unexpectedly.
Definition:
Event risk refers to the financial impact of unexpected, significant events that disrupt markets or institutions.Examples:
Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or corporate scandals trigger sudden and severe financial losses.
Definition:
The risk of widespread financial instability caused by the failure of a single large institution or a breakdown in a critical financial market, which can have ripple effects across the entire financial system.Examples:
The failure of a systemically important financial institution (SIFI), such as Lehman Brothers during the 2008 financial crisis.
A collapse in interbank lending markets leading to a liquidity crisis

Underlying Asset – Can be a stock, bond, loan, or an index (e.g., an equity index or a corporate bond).
Total Return Payer – The party that owns the asset and pays its total return (price appreciation and dividends/coupons).
Total Return Receiver – The counterparty that receives the total return and pays a financing cost, usually based on LIBOR, SOFR, or another floating rate.
Financing Leg – The total return receiver pays periodic payments (often floating rate) to compensate the payer for funding the position. Party A (the total return payer) holds an asset (e.g., a stock portfolio or a bond).
Party B (the total return receiver) wants exposure to the asset without owning it.
Party A agrees to pay Party B the total return of the asset, including price changes and income (dividends or coupons).
In return, Party B pays Party A a financing cost (often based on an interest rate such as SOFR or EURIBOR).
At the end of the swap, the net difference between the total return and the financing payments is settled.
Hedging – Banks and investors use TRS to hedge exposure to assets without selling them.
Leverage – Investors can gain exposure to assets without fully financing their purchase.
Balance Sheet Management – Banks use TRS to transfer risk without selling assets, keeping them off balance sheets. A hedge fund (receiver) enters into a TRS with a bank (payer) on a stock index.
The hedge fund receives the total return (capital gains and dividends) of the index.
In exchange, the hedge fund pays the bank a floating rate (e.g., SOFR + 1%).
If the index appreciates, the hedge fund profits; if it depreciates, the hedge fund pays the loss. Counterparty Risk – If one party defaults, the other may face losses.
Market Risk – The total return receiver is exposed to fluctuations in asset value.
Liquidity Risk – TRS contracts are OTC instruments, meaning they may have lower liquidity than exchange-traded derivatives.
A Total Return Swap (TRS) is a structured agreement where one party receives the total return of an asset while paying a financing cost. It allows investors to gain or hedge exposure without direct ownership and is widely used in hedging, leverage strategies, and balance sheet management.]]></description><link>total-return-swap-(trs).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Areas/Finance/Total Return Swap (TRS).md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 08:35:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tenor, Period and Term]]></title><description><![CDATA[The terms tenor, period, and term are often used interchangeably in financial markets, but they have distinct meanings depending on the context. Let’s clarify the differences:
Definition: The length of time until a financial instrument, contract, or agreement matures. Common Usage: Refers to the duration of a financial contract (e.g., loans, bonds, swaps, FRAs). In FRAs, a "6X9 FRA" has a tenor of 3 months (because it covers the period from 6 months to 9 months). Example: A 5-year bond has a tenor of 5 years. A 3-month interbank deposit has a tenor of 3 months. Definition: A specific time interval within a financial contract or calculation. Common Usage: Used in interest rate calculations, payments, or reset intervals. Can refer to interest compounding periods or coupon payment periods. Example: A floating rate loan with semi-annual interest payments has a 6-month interest period. A quarterly coupon bond has a 3-month period per coupon payment. Definition: The total lifespan or duration of a financial instrument from its start to maturity. Common Usage: Used to describe the entire duration of financial contracts like loans, bonds, and leases. Sometimes used synonymously with tenor, but “term” typically refers to the full duration from issuance rather than the remaining time. Example: A 30-year mortgage has a term of 30 years. A 1-year fixed deposit has a term of 1 year. Term is the total lifespan of a financial instrument.
Tenor is the length of time remaining or specified for a contract.
Period refers to specific intervals within the contract (e.g., interest payment periods).

Traders and investors use synthetic assets to gain exposure to an asset without direct ownership, often for cost efficiency, hedging, or regulatory reasons.
A trader can create a synthetic long stock position using options: Buying a call option (right to buy the stock at a certain price). Selling a put option (obligation to buy the stock at a certain price if exercised). This combination replicates the profit/loss profile of owning the stock itself. Instead of holding a foreign currency, a trader can use a foreign exchange forward to synthetically create an exposure. Example: A European investor needs exposure to USD but does not want to convert EUR into USD. The investor enters into a EUR/USD forward contract to receive USD in the future at a fixed exchange rate. This synthetically creates a USD asset without physically holding USD. An institution may use interest rate swaps (IRS) to synthetically create a fixed-rate bond exposure without buying a bond. Example: A bank receives floating-rate payments on an investment but wants fixed income. It enters into a swap where it receives fixed interest and pays floating interest. This creates a synthetic fixed-rate bond. A synthetic liability is a financial position that mimics the risk profile of an actual liability without directly incurring it. Institutions use synthetic liabilities for hedging, funding, and risk management.
A company in the US needs EUR funding but does not want to take a direct EUR loan. It issues a USD bond and simultaneously enters a USD/EUR currency swap, exchanging USD principal and interest for EUR. This effectively creates a synthetic EUR liability without taking an actual EUR loan. A firm has a floating-rate loan (e.g., LIBOR + 2%) but prefers fixed-rate payments. It enters into an interest rate swap, where it receives floating and pays fixed. This synthetically converts the floating-rate loan into a fixed-rate liability. A company that expects to pay in a foreign currency in the future but does not want immediate exposure to FX risk can short a futures contract in that currency. This effectively creates a synthetic liability in that currency, as if they had borrowed it. Hedging Risk – Avoid direct exposure to currency, interest rate, or equity market fluctuations.
Cost Efficiency – Derivatives and synthetic positions can be cheaper than direct holdings.
Regulatory Arbitrage – Some institutions use synthetic instruments to comply with capital requirements.
Liquidity Management – Allows firms to gain or avoid exposure without impacting cash reserves.

These strategies help traders manage exposure to interest rate movements over time.Stripping refers to a strategy where a trader maintains a hedge by using a series of short-term futures contracts instead of a single long-term futures contract. The trader continuously replaces (or "rolls") expiring contracts with new ones of shorter maturity.
Instead of buying or selling a long-dated futures contract, a trader enters into shorter-term futures contracts.
As each contract nears expiration, it is closed, and a new contract is entered into for the next available period.
This process is repeated continuously. Greater flexibility in adjusting positions based on market conditions.
Less exposure to long-term interest rate fluctuations. Requires frequent monitoring and transaction costs due to rolling.
Basis risk may arise if the new contracts are not perfectly aligned with the underlying exposure.
Stacking is a strategy where a trader initially establishes a large position in nearby futures contracts to hedge a longer-term exposure. As time progresses, these contracts are gradually reduced or rolled into new contracts.
A trader enters into a large number of short-term futures contracts at the beginning.
As the hedge period progresses, some contracts are rolled over or closed.
The position is gradually adjusted based on market conditions. Provides strong initial hedge protection.
Can be beneficial in a market with expected interest rate movements. Initial over-hedging may cause excessive risk exposure.
Requires careful management to adjust positions over time.
Both strategies are commonly used in managing interest rate risk with futures, and the choice between them depends on the trader’s risk appetite, market outlook, and hedging objectives.]]></description><link>stripping-and-stacking-futures.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Areas/Finance/Stripping and Stacking Futures.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 08:34:56 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stock Market Crashes]]></title><description><![CDATA[

First Transaction (Sell leg): Party A sells securities to Party B at the current market price
This happens at the start of the agreement Second Transaction (Buy leg): Party A agrees to buy back the same securities at a future date
The repurchase price includes an implied financing rate
Key differences from a standard repo:
Structured as two distinct transactions rather than one agreement
Coupon payments during the transaction period typically belong to the buyer (Party B)
Less legal protection compared to repos (since it's two separate trades)
Often used in markets where legal/tax framework for repos isn't well established
Example:
Bank A sells $10 million of bonds to Bank B for immediate settlement
Simultaneously, they agree Bank A will buy them back in 3 months
The repurchase price will include the original price plus financing costs
Main uses:
Short-term financing
Accessing specific securities
Alternative to standard repos in certain jurisdictions
Yield enhancement strategies
The key risk compared to repos is that since it's two separate transactions, there's potentially more counterparty risk if one party defaults between the two legs of the trade.]]></description><link>sell-buy-back.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Areas/Finance/Sell Buy Back.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 08:34:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Options]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Why Loans Are Considered Assets and Deposits Are Liabilities
The Interest Rate Risk from Funding Long-Term Fixed-Rate Assets with Short-Term Liabilities
How an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) Helps Hedge the Risk When a bank lends money (e.g., mortgages, corporate loans), it expects to receive interest payments and principal repayment from the borrower. These future cash inflows (interest and principal) represent an economic benefit, which qualifies loans as assets. A fixed-rate loan means the bank earns a fixed interest rate over time. When customers deposit money into a bank (e.g., savings accounts, current accounts), the bank owes this money back to the depositors. This means the bank has an obligation to repay, which makes deposits a liability. If these deposits are short-term (e.g., can be withdrawn anytime or have variable interest rates), the interest rate paid on them can fluctuate with market rates. You own long-term, fixed-rate assets (loans). This means you are earning a fixed interest rate over many years. You fund these loans with short-term, floating-rate liabilities (deposits). This means the interest rate you pay on deposits changes over time. If interest rates increase, the cost of funding (short-term liabilities) rises, but your earnings from fixed-rate loans stay the same. This reduces your profit margin.Example:
You gave a 10-year fixed-rate loan at 4% (earning 4%). You funded this loan with short-term deposits at 2% (paying 2%). If deposit rates rise to 3.5%, your funding cost increases, but your loan income remains 4%, reducing your profit margin. This is called a negative interest rate gap, which means rising rates hurt your profitability.To hedge against rising interest rates, you want to receive floating and pay fixed.
Enter into an interest rate swap (IRS) where you pay fixed and receive floating. This means you will: Pay a fixed rate in the swap (which offsets your fixed loan income). Receive a floating rate in the swap (which helps cover rising deposit costs). This effectively converts your fixed-rate loans into floating-rate loans, matching the floating-rate funding, so your exposure to rising rates is reduced.
You should "buy" an Interest Rate Swap (IRS), which means you "pay fixed and receive floating." This offsets the risk of rising short-term interest rates increasing your funding costs. ✅ Correct hedge = Buy an IRS = Pay fixed, receive floating.
Loans are assets because they generate income. Deposits are liabilities because they must be repaid. A mismatch between long-term fixed-rate assets and short-term floating-rate liabilities creates interest rate risk. Hedging with an IRS (pay fixed, receive floating) helps protect against rising interest rates by converting fixed assets to floating.

It is commonly used to hedge interest rate risk by fixing borrowing or lending costs in advance.FRAs are settled in cash based on the difference between the agreed FRA rate and the actual market rate at the contract’s settlement date. No principal amount is exchanged—only the interest differential is settled.Scenario:
A company expects to take out a 3-month loan of USD 10 million in 2 months. It is concerned that interest rates may rise before the loan starts.Solution:
The company buys a 2x5 FRA (an FRA starting in 2 months and lasting for 3 months). This locks in a fixed interest rate for the loan period. If interest rates rise, the FRA compensates the company for the additional borrowing cost. If interest rates fall, the company pays the FRA counterparty but benefits from lower loan costs. Settlement Calculation:
If the FRA rate is 3.00% and the actual market rate in 2 months is 3.50%, the company receives the interest difference. If the market rate is 2.50%, the company pays the difference. Outcome: The FRA acts as insurance against rising rates.Scenario:
A pension fund expects to receive USD 50 million in 3 months, which will be invested in a 6-month deposit. It worries that interest rates might fall, reducing its investment return.Solution:
The pension fund sells a 3x9 FRA (starting in 3 months, lasting for 6 months). This locks in a fixed return on the future investment. If interest rates fall, the FRA compensates the investor. If interest rates rise, the investor pays the difference but benefits from higher deposit rates. Outcome: The FRA ensures a minimum return on the investment.
FRA Buyers Hedge Against Rising Interest Rates (e.g., borrowers).
FRA Sellers Hedge Against Falling Interest Rates (e.g., investors).
FRAs Provide Cost Certainty by locking in future interest rates.
Only the Interest Differential Is Settled, making FRAs a cost-effective hedging tool. futures long -&gt; hedge against interest rates falling (like call option)
short -&gt; hedge against interest rates rising (like put option) FRAs long (buying fixed rate) -&gt; hedge against rising interest rates
short (selling fixed rate) -&gt; hedge against falling interest rates IRS long (buying fixed rate) -&gt; hedge against rising interest rates
short (selling fixed rate) -&gt; hedge against falling interest rate IRS and FRA: by buying fixed rate, if floating goes up, you've locked in a lower fixed rate (to pay)
by selling a fixed rate, if floating goes down, you've locked in a higher (to receive) Converting floating/fixed: if want to convert to fixed: floating assets: sell IRS/FRA (receive fixed instead of receiving floating) (receiving floating(asset) cancels pay floating (IRS)) floating liabilities: buy IRS/FRA (pay fixed instead of paying floating) (pay floating(liability) cancels receive floating(IRS))) if want to convert to floating: fixed assets: buy IRS/FRA (receive floating instead of receiving fixed) (receiving fixed(asset) cancels paying fixed(IRS)) fixed liabilities: sell IRS/FRA (pay floating instead of paying fixed) (paying fixed(liability) cancels out receiving fixed(IRS)) look at pay or receive (liability? or asset?) receiving -&gt; asset
paying -&gt; liability what you're getting, floating or fixed? (buy or sell?) floating payments / receipts
fixed payments / receipts
get opposite of that e.g. floating asset -&gt; floating receipts: therefore want fixed receipts: therefore sell IRS hedging instruments for short term interest rate risk STIR futures

Below is a detailed explanation of both concepts, their calculations, inclusions/exclusions, interpretations, and uses, as well as their key differences.GDP is the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific time period (usually quarterly or annually). It measures domestic economic activity.GDP can be calculated using three different approaches, all of which should theoretically produce the same result: Production Approach (Output Approach)
GDP=∑(Value&nbsp;of&nbsp;Output−Value&nbsp;of&nbsp;Intermediate&nbsp;Goods)GDP = \sum (\text{Value of Output} - \text{Value of Intermediate Goods})GDP=∑(Value&nbsp;of&nbsp;Output−Value&nbsp;of&nbsp;Intermediate&nbsp;Goods) Focuses on the total value added at each stage of production. Expenditure Approach (Most Common)
GDP=C+I+G+(X−M)GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)GDP=C+I+G+(X−M) C = Consumption (household spending on goods and services)
I = Investment (business capital expenditures, construction, inventories)
G = Government Spending (public services, defense, infrastructure)
X = Exports (goods/services sold abroad)
M = Imports (goods/services bought from abroad)
(X - M) = Net Exports (trade balance) Income Approach
GDP=W+R+I+PGDP = W + R + I + PGDP=W+R+I+P W = Wages (income from labor)
R = Rent (income from land and property)
I = Interest (income from investments)
P = Profits (corporate earnings and business income) Final goods and services (to avoid double counting).
Production within the country, regardless of ownership (e.g., foreign companies operating domestically).
Both private and public sector activities. Intermediate goods (already included in final product value).
Non-market transactions (household work, volunteer services).
Underground economy (illegal activities, unreported transactions).
Second-hand goods (only new production counts).
Financial transactions (stocks, bonds, transfer payments). Indicator of economic health: A growing GDP suggests economic expansion, while a shrinking GDP may indicate recession.
Comparison across countries: Helps assess economic performance on a global scale.
Policy decision-making: Central banks and governments use GDP data to set monetary and fiscal policies.
Business and investment decisions: Companies analyze GDP trends to make strategic investment choices.
GNP is the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced by a country’s residents, regardless of location. It focuses on national ownership rather than geographic location.GNP=GDP+Net&nbsp;Income&nbsp;from&nbsp;AbroadGNP = GDP + \text{Net Income from Abroad}GNP=GDP+Net&nbsp;Income&nbsp;from&nbsp;Abroad GNP=GDP+(Income&nbsp;earned&nbsp;by&nbsp;nationals&nbsp;abroad−Income&nbsp;earned&nbsp;by&nbsp;foreigners&nbsp;domestically)GNP = GDP + (\text{Income earned by nationals abroad} - \text{Income earned by foreigners domestically})GNP=GDP+(Income&nbsp;earned&nbsp;by&nbsp;nationals&nbsp;abroad−Income&nbsp;earned&nbsp;by&nbsp;foreigners&nbsp;domestically)
All goods and services produced by a country’s citizens and businesses, regardless of where they are located.
Net foreign income (e.g., wages earned by nationals working abroad, profits from overseas businesses). Economic activity generated by foreign-owned businesses and workers inside the country.
Any income that does not belong to nationals (e.g., foreign corporations' profits in the domestic economy). Measure of national wealth: Indicates how much income a country’s citizens generate.
Better for countries with significant overseas investments: Nations with many multinational firms might prefer GNP over GDP.
Policy guidance: Governments consider GNP when making policies on taxation, foreign investment, and global economic participation. GDP is the primary measure of a country’s economic activity within its borders.
GNP extends beyond borders to include income earned by a nation’s citizens worldwide.
Countries with significant foreign investments or expatriate workers may have large differences between GDP and GNP.
Policymakers use both GDP and GNP to assess economic conditions and set appropriate economic policies.

The market maker's role involves both buying and selling currencies at different points in time.Here's how it works:
The market maker buys at the bid price and sells at the offer price (just like in a regular FX trade).
In an FX swap, the market maker is simultaneously entering into two transactions: A spot transaction (T+2 settlement in most cases)
A forward transaction (reversing the spot trade at a future date) On the bid side: The market maker buys the near leg (spot or short-term date)
Simultaneously sells the far leg (forward date)
The bid price represents the swap points at which the market maker is willing to do this. On the offer side: The market maker sells the near leg
Simultaneously buys the far leg
The offer price represents the swap points at which the market maker is willing to do this. Let’s say the spot EUR/USD rate is 1.1000 and the swap points for a one-month swap are quoted as 5/7 (meaning bid = 5, offer = 7).
If a customer wants to buy EUR forward, they will pay the offer (7 swap points), meaning their forward rate will be 1.1007.
If a customer wants to sell EUR forward, they will receive the bid (5 swap points), meaning their forward rate will be 1.1005.
Thus, as a market maker, you:
Buy at the bid (5 swap points)
Sell at the offer (7 swap points)

Here is a breakdown of each:
Definition: A forward contract (or forward agreement) is a customized agreement between two parties to buy or sell an underlying asset (which can be a currency, commodity, or financial instrument) at a specified future date for a price agreed upon today.
Key Characteristics: Customizable: Terms (like contract size, settlement dates, and asset type) can be tailored to the needs of the contracting parties.
Over-the-Counter (OTC): These contracts are traded privately between two parties, typically not involving an exchange.
Settlement: The contract is typically settled at the maturity date, and delivery of the underlying asset may occur, or it may be settled in cash.
Risk: There is counterparty risk because the contract is not standardized or centrally cleared. Definition: A Forward Rate Agreement is a specific type of forward contract where the underlying asset is an interest rate. An FRA is an agreement between two parties to exchange interest payments based on a notional principal at a future date.
Key Characteristics: Interest Rate Focus: Unlike forwards which may involve various types of assets, FRAs specifically deal with interest rates (usually on short-term lending or borrowing).
Cash Settlement: FRAs are typically settled in cash, based on the difference between the agreed-upon interest rate and the market rate at the settlement time.
Over-the-Counter (OTC): Like forwards, FRAs are negotiated directly between two parties and are not standardized or traded on exchanges.
Common Usage: Often used by banks, corporations, and investors to hedge or speculate on interest rate movements. Definition: A futures contract is a standardized agreement traded on an exchange to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date, at a price agreed upon today.
Key Characteristics: Standardized: The terms of futures contracts (such as contract size, expiration date, and settlement procedures) are standardized by the exchange, meaning they are the same for all participants.
Exchange-Traded: Futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges such as the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), which ensures liquidity and transparency.
Daily Settlement: Futures contracts are marked-to-market daily, meaning that profits and losses are settled every day, and margin accounts are adjusted accordingly.
Lower Counterparty Risk: Futures contracts are cleared by a central clearinghouse, which significantly reduces counterparty risk.
Highly Liquid: Due to the standardization and exchange-trading, futures contracts generally have higher liquidity compared to forwards and FRAs. Forward Contracts are customizable agreements typically used in OTC markets for a wide range of assets.
FRAs are a specific type of forward contract used primarily for hedging or speculating on interest rate changes.
Futures Contracts are standardized contracts traded on exchanges with daily settlement and lower counterparty risk, providing high liquidity.
Each of these instruments serves distinct purposes based on the level of customization required, the asset type involved, and the risk profile of the parties involved.See <a data-href="2025-03-26_04-59 FX Summary" href="2025-03-26_04-59-fx-summary.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">2025-03-26_04-59 FX Summary</a>

If a holiday or other closure affects this two day period the Spot value date moves forward to the next business day

Understanding dates like spot dates, forward dates, value dates, trade dates, maturity dates, and settlement dates is essential for managing transactions across financial instruments, as these govern the flow of payments and obligations in the financial markets. Below is a detailed explanation of how these dates function for various instruments, as per the ACI syllabus.
Definition: The date on which a financial transaction (e.g., spot, forward, bond purchase) is agreed upon between counterparties.
Purpose: It marks the beginning of the transaction lifecycle.
Application Across Instruments: FX: The trade date is when the parties agree to exchange currencies.
Bonds: The trade date is when the bond buyer and seller agree on the terms (e.g., price, yield).
Derivatives: The trade date initiates the derivative contract (e.g., futures or swaps). Definition: The date when the cash or securities involved in a transaction are exchanged and settled.
Purpose: Indicates when the transaction is finalized and becomes effective.
Application Across Instruments: FX Spot: The value date is typically T+2 (two business days after the trade date).
FX Forward: The value date is agreed upon and corresponds to the forward tenor (e.g., 1 month, 3 months, etc.).
Money Market Instruments: The value date is usually T+0, T+1, or T+2, depending on the market convention.
Bonds: The value date is when ownership of the bond is transferred, typically T+2. Definition: The standard settlement date for a spot transaction, typically T+2 in most financial markets.
Purpose: Used as the starting point for calculating forward dates.
Application Across Instruments: FX Spot: For most currency pairs, the spot date is two business days after the trade date (T+2), except for pairs like USD/CAD and USD/TRY, which settle on T+1.
Bonds and Equities: Spot date aligns with the market's settlement convention (commonly T+2).
Commodities: Spot settlement depends on the commodity exchange’s rules. Definition: A value date beyond the spot date, agreed upon for forward transactions.
Purpose: Specifies when the transaction will settle in the future.
Application Across Instruments: FX Forward: The forward date is derived from the spot date by adding the agreed tenor (e.g., 1 month, 3 months).
Interest Rate Swaps: The forward start date defines when the interest payments or obligations begin.
Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs): The forward date is when the notional interest period begins. Definition: The date on which a financial instrument expires or the principal amount is repaid.
Purpose: Represents the end of the transaction lifecycle.
Application Across Instruments: FX Forward/Swaps: The maturity date is when the final exchange of currencies takes place.
Bonds: The maturity date is when the bondholder receives the principal and last coupon payment.
Money Market Instruments: Maturity corresponds to the date when the issuer repays the loan (e.g., certificates of deposit, treasury bills).
Derivatives: Futures or options contracts mature on pre-determined dates. Definition: The date when the actual transfer of cash, securities, or other assets occurs.
Purpose: Ensures that all parties fulfill their contractual obligations.
Application Across Instruments: FX: Settlement occurs on the value date when the agreed currencies are exchanged.
Bonds and Equities: Settlement typically occurs on T+2 or T+1, depending on the market.
Commodities: Settlement happens when the physical commodity or cash equivalent is delivered. Spot Transaction: Trade Date: Monday, 1st February 2025
Spot Date: Wednesday, 3rd February 2025 (T+2)
Value Date: Same as the spot date (3rd February 2025). 1-Month Forward: Trade Date: Monday, 1st February 2025

It is used across various financial markets to describe the time period for which money is lent, borrowed, or invested. Time Frame: A tenor specifies the duration of a contract or financial instrument, such as 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, or longer.
It is expressed in terms of days, months, or years. Instruments Where Tenor Applies: Foreign Exchange (FX): For forward contracts, the tenor defines the time period beyond the spot date (e.g., 1 month forward).
Money Market Instruments: Tenor defines the duration of instruments like certificates of deposit, treasury bills, or repos.
Loans &amp; Bonds: In loans or fixed-income securities, tenor refers to the time remaining until the principal is repaid.
Derivatives: Tenor determines the lifespan of a futures or options contract or an interest rate swap. Spot vs. Forward Tenor: Spot Tenor: Usually T+2 (two business days) in FX markets.
Forward Tenor: A specific period added to the spot date, such as 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year. Maturity and Tenor Relationship: The maturity date is the date on which the tenor ends.
For example, if a bond is issued with a 5-year tenor on 1st January 2025, it will mature on 1st January 2030. Foreign Exchange (FX): Spot Transaction: Has a standard tenor of 2 business days (T+2).
Forward Contracts: A tenor of 1 month, 3 months, or any agreed period beyond T+2. Money Market Instruments: A 90-day certificate of deposit has a tenor of 90 days from issuance.
A 7-day repo agreement has a tenor of 7 days. Bonds: A 10-year bond issued today has a tenor of 10 years, but after 2 years, its remaining tenor will be 8 years. Derivatives (Interest Rate Swaps): An interest rate swap with a tenor of 5 years implies payments and settlements will occur periodically for 5 years. Pricing: Tenor impacts the pricing of financial instruments. For example: Longer tenors typically involve greater uncertainty, resulting in higher yields or premiums.
Shorter tenors often attract lower yields due to reduced risk. Liquidity: Instruments with shorter tenors tend to have higher liquidity since they mature quickly. Risk Management: The tenor affects exposure to credit risk, interest rate risk, and market risk.
Longer tenors generally involve higher risks because they extend over a longer period.

Below is a comprehensive table summarizing the key dates to take into account for various financial instruments, as covered in the ACI syllabus: Trade Date (T): The date on which the transaction is agreed between parties.
Applies universally to all instruments. Spot Date: The standard settlement date for spot transactions, typically T+2 in most markets.
Not relevant for all instruments (e.g., options or FRAs). Value Date: The date when cash flows, securities, or commodities are exchanged.
For FX and bonds, this typically coincides with the spot date or forward date. Maturity Date: The end date of the instrument or contract, when principal or final obligations are settled.
Applies to bonds, loans, forwards, swaps, and other instruments. Settlement Date: The date on which the actual transfer of assets (e.g., cash or securities) occurs.
For spot transactions, this is typically the same as the value date. Other Dates: Coupon Payment Dates: For bonds, these are pre-specified dates on which interest payments are made.
Expiry Date: The final date for options or futures contracts.
Fixing Date: For FRAs or swaps, the date when the interest rate is determined.

This is the starting point of the transaction lifecycle, marking the day when the terms of the trade (e.g., price, amount, tenor, value date, etc.) are finalized. Initiation of the Trade: The deal date is the day on which the parties enter into an agreement for a transaction, such as an FX trade, bond purchase, money market deposit, or derivative contract. Time of Agreement: The actual time of the deal within the day is important for determining whether it falls into the current business day or rolls over to the next (based on market cutoff times). Basis for Other Dates: Other dates, such as the spot date, value date, and maturity date, are calculated based on the deal date. It serves as the reference point for calculating other dates, such as the spot date, value date, and maturity date.
It is a record-keeping marker, as financial transactions must be recorded based on the date the trade is struck.
It determines cutoff times for a transaction, as trades executed after a market's cutoff time are assigned the next business day as the deal date. Deal Date: Monday, 5th February 2025.
Spot Date: Wednesday, 7th February 2025 (T+2 from the deal date).
Value Date: Same as the spot date: 7th February 2025.

It helps investors and risk managers assess interest rate risk and manage bond portfolios effectively.Duration is a measure of the weighted average time an investor needs to wait to receive a bond’s cash flows (coupons + principal). It also serves as an approximate measure of price sensitivity to interest rate changes.There are several types of duration:
Macaulay Duration – Measures the weighted average time to receive cash flows.
Modified Duration – Measures price sensitivity to changes in yield.
Effective Duration – Accounts for bonds with embedded options.
Macaulay Duration (Dm) represents the weighted average time (in years) until a bondholder receives cash flows. It is calculated as:<img alt="Pasted image 20250320152142.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250320152142.png" target="_self">
If a bond has a Macaulay Duration of 5 years, this means the weighted average time to recover the initial investment is 5 years.
It is primarily useful for matching assets and liabilities in fixed income portfolios. <br>Think mismatching and gap analysis in ACI: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="ACI Textbook1.pdf > page=449&amp;selection=72,0,72,15" data-href="ACI Textbook1.pdf#page=449&amp;selection=72,0,72,15" href="resources/attachments/aci-textbook1.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">ACI Textbook1, page 449</a> Modified Duration (D*m​) measures the percentage change in a bond’s price for a 1% change in yield and is derived from Macaulay Duration (see Dm in the formula)aa:<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250320152230.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250320152230.png" target="_self">The bond price change is estimated using:<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250320152246.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250320152246.png" target="_self">
Example:
If a bond has:
Price = $1,000
Modified Duration = 6
Yield increases by 1% (0.01 in decimal)
Then:<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250320152303.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250320152303.png" target="_self">New Price:<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250320152313.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250320152313.png" target="_self">Thus, the bond price falls to $940 when the yield rises by 1%.For callable or putable bonds, the cash flows are uncertain due to optionality. Effective duration measures sensitivity to interest rate changes by incorporating potential cash flow changes. It is estimated using a pricing model:<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250320152407.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250320152407.png" target="_self">
Used in risk disclosures for bond portfolios in financial institutions.
Reported as a weighted average duration for diversified portfolios. Banks and pension funds use duration matching to minimize interest rate risk.
Duration gap measures mismatch between asset and liability durations. Regulators (Basel III) require banks to monitor duration risk.
Hedging strategies use duration-based derivatives (e.g., interest rate swaps). Macaulay Duration helps measure time-weighted cash flows.
Modified Duration provides an estimate of price sensitivity.
Effective Duration is used when bonds have optionality.
Duration is essential for pricing, reporting, and interest rate risk management. Duration is a NPV of cash flows which are time weighted.
Duration can be used to rank bonds’ price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It can be used as a tool for managing interest rate risk. Duration is the weighted average cash flow of a bond, where the present values of the cash flows serve as the weights adjusted by time. Duration is the future point in TIME at which, on average, the investor has received exactly half of the original investment in PV terms.
Modified Duration: defined as “the percentage change in a bond’s dirty price for a 1 p.c. change in yield”
Modified Duration is an estimate of the bond’s price sensitivity to changes in yield.
Acts as a multiplier
"Price acceleration or deceleration" Effective duration: used instead of modified duration because the presence of prepayments changes the level of cash flow (seldom the case in wholesale market transactions). Modified duration assumes constant cash flow.
As market yields rise, effective duration lengthens and price declines accelerate compared with what is implied by the instrument’s modified duration. The price increase associated with a given decline in interest rates is smaller than the price decrease for the same size interest rate increase.

Yield Instruments: These are interest-bearing instruments that pay periodic interest or accrue interest over time, with the investor receiving both principal and accrued interest at maturity. CDs fall into this category as they typically have a stated interest rate and pay interest periodically or at maturity. Discount Instruments: These are issued at a discount to their face value and do not pay periodic interest; instead, the investor earns a return by purchasing the instrument at a lower price and receiving the full face value at maturity. Examples include Treasury bills and commercial paper.
Yield means starts higher and becomes par
Discount means starts low and accrues to face value
e.g. Face Value (FV): $1,000,000
Discount Rate: 5.25% per annum
Days to Maturity: 90 days
The discount amount is the difference between the face value and the purchase price. It is calculated as:<img alt="Pasted image 20250129101742.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250129101742.png" target="_self">The investor buys the BA at a discount from face value:<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250129101804.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250129101804.png" target="_self">Since the investor earns $13,125 over 90 days, the money market yield (MMY) is:<br><img alt="Pasted image 20250129101823.png" src="resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250129101823.png" target="_self">
Purchase Price: $986,875
Discount Earned: $13,125
Investor’s Annualized Yield (MMY): 5.33%

They function as options on interest rates, providing protection against unfavourable rate fluctuations.An Interest Rate Cap is a series of European-style call options (known as caplets) on a floating interest rate, typically LIBOR, SOFR, or EURIBOR.
Purpose: Protects against rising interest rates.
Buyer’s Benefit: If the floating rate exceeds the agreed cap rate, the seller pays the difference.
Seller’s Role: The seller receives an upfront premium and compensates the buyer when rates rise above the cap. A company with a floating-rate loan (e.g., LIBOR + 2%) buys a cap at 5%.
If LIBOR rises to 6%, the cap seller pays the difference (6% - 5% = 1%) on the notional amount.
If LIBOR stays below 5%, no payment is made.
An Interest Rate Floor is a series of European-style put options (known as floorlets) on a floating interest rate.
Purpose: Protects against falling interest rates.
Buyer’s Benefit: If the floating rate falls below the agreed floor rate, the seller pays the difference.
Seller’s Role: The seller receives an upfront premium and compensates the buyer when rates drop below the floor. A bank holding floating-rate assets (e.g., loans earning LIBOR + 1%) buys a floor at 3%.
If LIBOR drops to 2%, the floor seller pays the difference (3% - 2% = 1%) on the notional amount.
If LIBOR stays above 3%, no payment is made.
A collar combines a cap and a floor:
The borrower buys a cap (protecting against high rates).
The borrower sells a floor (accepting lower rates in exchange for reduced or zero premium).
This strategy reduces the cost of hedging but limits gains from falling rates.

Used for hedging: Traders use BPV to hedge bond portfolios by adjusting positions in response to yield changes.
Risk management: Helps banks and asset managers quantify portfolio exposure to small interest rate movements. BPV (Price Value of a Basis Point): Expressed in bond price units (e.g., euros, dollars).
DV01 (Dollar Value of 01 Basis Point): The same concept but specifically in dollar terms.

Notes: Something like an IRS isn't an asset so wouldn't be on the balance sheet, would have it's cashflows recorded on the income statement. A bond is something you physically hold because you know the future value but an IRS isn't an asset, so it'd be off-balance sheet. In accounting and financial reporting, assets, liabilities, and commitments can be classified as on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet depending on whether they are recorded on a company's financial statements.These are assets and liabilities that appear directly on the balance sheet because the company has ownership, control, or direct financial exposure.
Cash and Cash Equivalents – Physical cash, bank deposits, and highly liquid short-term investments.
Loans and Advances – Loans issued by banks and financial institutions.
Securities – Bonds, equities, and other marketable investments owned by the entity.
Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) – Physical assets used in business operations.
Inventory – Goods held for sale or production. Deposits – Customer funds held by a bank.
Borrowings – Short-term and long-term debt obligations.
Trade Payables – Money owed to suppliers.
Bond Issuances – Debt securities issued to investors. Recognized in financial statements.
Directly affects financial ratios, leverage, and regulatory capital requirements.
These are financial commitments, contingent liabilities, or assets not recorded on the balance sheet because they do not represent a direct obligation or ownership at the time of reporting. However, they can still create future liabilities or risks.
Letters of Credit (LCs) – Guarantees issued by banks to ensure payment in international trade.
Loan Commitments – Unused lines of credit that a bank has promised to lend but has not yet disbursed.
Guarantees and Warranties – Promises to cover a third party’s obligation if they default. Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) – Agreements to exchange interest rate cash flows, with no principal recorded on the balance sheet.
Currency Forwards &amp; Options – Used for FX hedging, with only changes in value reflected in financial statements.
Credit Default Swaps (CDS) – Insurance-like derivatives on credit events, recorded off-balance sheet until exercised. Securitized Loans (Mortgage-Backed Securities, MBS) – Banks package and sell loans to investors, removing them from the balance sheet.
Leasing Arrangements (Operating Leases) – Previously off-balance sheet (before IFRS 16), meaning companies used leased assets without recording them as liabilities. Not recognized as direct assets or liabilities but can create future obligations.
Used to manage risk, improve financial ratios, or comply with regulatory requirements. On-Balance Sheet items include assets and liabilities that a company owns or owes directly and are fully recorded in financial statements.
Off-Balance Sheet items involve potential obligations, contingent liabilities, or transferred risks that are not fully recognized but still impact financial health and risk exposure.
Financial institutions use off-balance sheet transactions to manage risk, optimize capital efficiency, and meet regulatory requirements while keeping certain exposures out of core financial statements.]]></description><link>balance-sheet-items.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Areas/Finance/Balance Sheet Items.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 08:33:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Assets and Liabilities]]></title><description><![CDATA[

More interest rate sensitive assets than liabilities
issued more loans than holding deposits
exposed to falling interest rates (decrease in interest payments from your assets (loans)) would want to hedge against falling interest rates: sell IRS (receive fixed rate)
sell FRA (receive fixed rate)
buy future (lock in future fixed price)
Buy IR floor Impact of Interest Rate Changes:
If interest rates increase → Profits increase (as loan income rises more than funding costs).
If interest rates decrease → Profits decrease (as loan income drops more than funding costs).
🔹 Example of an Overlent Position:
Assets (loans): Mostly floating-rate loans.
Liabilities (deposits): Mostly fixed-rate deposits.
Risk: If rates fall, interest income decreases while funding costs remain fixed, reducing profits. more interest rate-sensitive liabilities than assets. more deposits than loans (more liabilities than assets) exposed to rise in interest rates (paying back on your deposits) protect against rising interest rates
(Do this by converting floating rate liabilities into fixed-rate liabilities) buy IRS (pay fixed)
