More interest rate sensitive assets than liabilities
issued more loans than holding deposits
exposed to falling interest rates (decrease in interest payments from your assets (loans)) would want to hedge against falling interest rates: sell IRS (receive fixed rate)
sell FRA (receive fixed rate)
buy future (lock in future fixed price)
Buy IR floor Impact of Interest Rate Changes:
If interest rates increase â†’ Profits increase (as loan income rises more than funding costs).
If interest rates decrease â†’ Profits decrease (as loan income drops more than funding costs).
ðŸ”¹ Example of an Overlent Position:
Assets (loans): Mostly floating-rate loans.
Liabilities (deposits): Mostly fixed-rate deposits.
Risk: If rates fall, interest income decreases while funding costs remain fixed, reducing profits. more interest rate-sensitive liabilities than assets. more deposits than loans (more liabilities than assets) exposed to rise in interest rates (paying back on your deposits) protect against rising interest rates
(Do this by converting floating rate liabilities into fixed-rate liabilities) buy IRS (pay fixed)
buy FRA (pay fixed)
sell future (lock in fixed price)
