The current account shows the net amount a country is earning if it is in surplus, or spending if it is in deficit. It is the sum of the balance of trade (net earnings on exports less payments for imports), factor income (earnings on foreign investments less payments made to foreign investors) and cash transfers. phases of economy expansion\npeak recession\ntrough <br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"winforextextModDCNV21Pr ACI Textbook2.pdf > page=45&amp;selection=13,0,19,39\" data-href=\"winforextextModDCNV21Pr ACI Textbook2.pdf#page=45&amp;selection=13,0,19,39\" href=\"resources/attachments/winforextextmoddcnv21pr-aci-textbook2.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Money Supply</a> GNP is NOT a measure of inflation Technical Analysis AKA Charting The Efficient Market Hypothesis, or EMH, is an investment theory developed in the 1970s which states that prices reflect all available information If markets are efficient, then all information has already been discounted in the price, and so there is no way to \"beat\" the market because there are no undervalued or overvalued currencies/securities available\ncan't beat market and will be arbitraged away In the majority of OTC markets (interbank wholesale markets) it is the custom for the calling counterparty (market user) to ask the market maker for his two way price (to Buy/Sell in foreign exchange markets and the Borrow/lend in interest rate markets – though some interest rate/discount rate based short term securities can also be ‘bought’ and ‘sold’ in these markets).

Thus a default on the collateral (however unthinkable in respect of government debt) would require the seller to supply new collateral Because of the fixed price of the repurchase (i.e. in cash driven transactions the same as the initial consideration plus repo interest), any fall in the price of the collateral is automatically a loss to the seller and any rise in the price of the collateral is automatically a gain bond's clean price is what is usually quoted (remember without interest) quoted per 100 (par) For example, in the case of Gilts this could be 98.50 meaning GBP 98.50 per GBP 100 face value sum of present value of all future cashflows (cashflow discount model)\nPricing above/below par: As bonds are typically fixed income securities they may be priced below, at or above par value.\nBond prices below the par value: indicate that current interest rates are higher than the bond coupon\nmeaning an investor to achieve current interest rates overall must buy at a discount Bond prices above the par value indicate that current interest rates must be lower than the bond coupon\nmeaning an investor, to achieve current interest rates overall is prepared to pay a premium.

This is his estimate of what implied volatility will be over the option time to expiry. The market user then decides whether this is in line with or differs from his own view. If the market user believes volatility will be lower he sells (volatility) to the market 351 maker’s bid of 10 p.c. If he believes volatility will be higher than 10 ¼ p.c. he buys (volatility). Once this has been agreed the buyer of volatility is the buyer of the option and the Premium is then calculated using all data elements now available. On agreement of the transaction the Premium is then payable (on deal date) by the buyer to the seller.Price may be in another currency even if it's EUR call / USD putBreak even:\nFor the holder of a Call this is the strike price plus premium paid (points in rate). For the holder of a Put this is the Strike price less the premium paid (points in rate).An ITM option will ALWAYS be exercised. An OTM option will not be exercised and is described as expiring “worthless”. On exercise an OTC Currency option becomes a standard Spot foreign exchange transaction between the two parties and is then subject to routine credit risk concerns (i.e. delivery risk).For example, if a change of 1 percent in the exchange rate causes the currency option premium to change by 0.5 percent then the delta is described as being 0.5The Delta represents the speed with which an option price will change relative to the underlying. It gives an idea of the probability that the option will be In-the- money at expiry. It can be described as the option’s “pay-off”.Delta is a ratio between 0-1\nATM -&gt; 0.5\nITM -&gt; close to 1\nOTM -&gt; close to 0 Small changes in the price of the underlying will not alter the Premium.delta -&gt; velocity\ngamma -&gt; acceleration\nvolacity is how fast you're going\nacceleration is how fast you're speeding upGamma will be large when an option is at-the-money and near to expiry.

This is the risk and there are limits used in a bank to control and monitor this risk. Market Risk (market by market and product by product) FX risk transaction exposure For example a UK exporter invoicing in foreign currency and being paid by his customers abroad in foreign currency has an exchange risk against local currency (GBP) with every export order (transaction) he fills and for which he issues an invoice. The company has three choices: to cover (sell) the risk – by dealing with a bank in the traditional foreign exchange cash market,\nto hedge (insure against) the risk – by using treasury derivatives such as currency options\nor to run the risk. Provided the risk has been identified and the management are happy then running the risk can be considered a risk management decision. translation exposure reported as one currency in the balance sheet but different elsewhere Economic exposure Economic risk may be mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange or Currency options hedging strategies.\nMay arise when dealing with countries with different interest rates or exchanges and have your competitors in different countries using different exchange rates MR - Cash foreign exchange instruments financial institution exchange exposure\nMarket risk position limits\ncentral bank limits / in-bank limits banks limited by central bank\nreferred to as Overnight Open Exchange Position Limit\nManaged by Risk Management Department exchange risk Comes from \"Open Exchange Positions\" and fact that exchanges fluctuate\ndefinition: The open exchange position can be defined as the difference between total assets and total liabilities, regardless of value date, in any currency, or pair of, or group of currencies. Here the bank will include assets and liabilities which are not all dealer initiated, i.e. interest accrual positions in foreign currencies\nLong (overbought) position in a currency which rises against the comparator currency will result in a profit, whereas a short position in such a currency will result in a loss.

It comes as a result from the maintenance of the mismatch (gaps) of maturity positions of cash market spot against forward purchases and sales. Such as for foreign currency pairs and off-balance sheet derivative products like n-d-fs and all are effective on a forward/forward basis.\nIt's measured per currency pair, per currency and on a consolidated basis with spot exchange positions and interest arbitrage operations included such as money market balancing items in the Mismatch (Gap) reporting where deemed appropriate.\nAnother good approach is to use a similar one to money market interest rate risk MR - FICC Derivatives (Exchange traded Currency Options) market risk comes from the underlying exchange rate or interest rate having volatility which fluctuates due to adverse market conditions\nwith options, Buyers: the potential loss is limited to the premium and the upside is (potentially) unlimited\nSellers (writers): the potential loss is unlimited and the profit is limited to the premium (margin) long/overbought call (put) on a commodity/currency/IR where option price (premium/margin) rises will result in a profit (loss) MR - FICC Derivatives (OTC Currency / interest rate options) same risk with positions like described above\nhedging method = delta hedging for sold/written options using a computed model which looks at the proportion of cover in the underlying (be it cash or security) market required given your current position in the market and also looking at trends.

Credit Risk (Market by market and product by product) CR - Spot foreign exchange Delivery risk (Herstatt risk) Foreign exchange market = cash market\non value date, currencies involved must be physically delivered as agreed upon as per the contract\nIf the bank doesn't receive the currency in the contract and has already paid the countervalue (the other side of the currency be it the foreign one or the local one) then the risk is 100% of what was already paid away\nIt's a daily risk assessment of both spot and forward outstandings\nThe risk department limits with with a single metric -&gt; \"delivery risk limit\" when it creates counterparty credit limits\ndelivery risk may also arise due to middle eastern markets due to differing Islamic weekend/holiday dates\nbilateral netting and CLS reduce impact of this risk\npayment netting reduces settlement risk f counterparties are to exchange multiple cash on any value date, they can agree to net those cash flows to one payment per currency. Not only does such payment netting reduce settlement risk, it also economises on processing procedures. CR - Forward foreign exchange Cash market\nalso subject to Delivery risk If, in a non CLS currency or a transaction with a non CLS counterparty, for some reason the bank does not receive the currency contracted to be purchased and has already paid away the countervalue in local or another foreign currency then the risk is 100% of the sums so paid away. Market replacement risk additional Credit risk in forward foreign exchange\nthis is where if like in credit risk, a counterparty defaults, not only on top of that but now to replace their positions you're also subject to changes in interest rates and exchange rates\nA transaction is only completed by the receiver in Mega Bank if it results in a profit against replacement at the current market rate. If the transaction results in a profit to Major Bank (Loss to the receiver) this contract will more than likely NOT be completed. If the transaction results in a profit to the receiver this contract will be completed – this is assessed as “zero” risk. This process is referred to in legal terms as specific performance or “cherry picking” and results in asymmetric risk.\nyou basically look at the exchange rates in the contract and see whether doing it in the market would be more favourable or not\nif it's less favourable, you're subject to market replacement risk (they offered you a lower rate, or a higher rate) and that difference is then your market replacement risk CR mitigation techniques Foreign Exchange FX\nnetting reduces credit exposure and processing and payment costs\nThese netting arrangements only apply to foreign exchange transactions in the same currency pairings dealt for the same value date and the terms of all such netting are agreed bilaterally between the banks.\nhelps with market replacement risk (see above)\nThis risk does not disappear if default of the counterparty means a potential “profit” i.e. a better rate than contractually agreed is then available. The concept of “specific performance” with the receiver in bankruptcy being able to decide which contracts to complete means that transactions resulting in a profit to the defaulting party would be completed and those resulting in a loss would be allowed to fail. Netting by novation is one way to reduce this market replacement risk.\nClose-out netting Reduces pre-settlement risk\nnegates \"cherry picking\" CLS Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) is an industry initiative to reduce the risks associated with cross-currency transactions. These risks have been principally caused by delays due to time-zone differences.

Unlike the Futures Markets clearing houses CLS Bank does not guarantee the settlement of every instruction that is submitted for settlement, nor provide protection against the failure of forward trades nor become a counterparty to any underlying cross-currency transaction, however, once an instruction is settled, CLS Bank ensures that each Member will receive the payment to which it is entitled from CLS Bank in accordance with its rules and risk management procedures.

If you have lent unsecured money the risk is that the counterparty will go bankrupt before maturity date and you will not receive back the amount of your advance.\nLoans The credit risk is in the name of the borrower of cash. CR (and Counterparty Dealing Limits) - Financial Instruments Repos The credit risk is on the issuer of the collateral (typically government securities therefore typically lower risk than comparator commercial collateral transactions). T-Bills The credit risk is in the name of the government issuer (typically lower risk than comparator commercial issues). Eligible Bills / Bankers Acceptances The credit risk is in the name of the Acceptor (guarantor) CDs Purchased at Issue The credit risk is in the name of the issuer of the CD. Secondary CDs purchased The credit risk is in the name of the issuer of the CD. In certain financial centres where physical settlement of such instruments takes place, there is also a delivery risk in the name of the seller of the CD between the date of payment and receipt of the financial instrument purchased. Commercial Paper The credit risk is in the name of the issuing company i.e. Commercial risk or, in some countries, financial institution. Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) There are currently around 30 central securities depositories (CSD) in the European Union. Euroclear (Belgium) and Clearstream (Luxembourg) act as depositories for international securities and have their own account in most CSDs in Europe and beyond. These entities are referred to as CCPs (Central Clearing Counterparties) within the Basel rules. In all transactions which involve exchanging cash for security/collateral you're subjected to delivery risk (daylight or intra-day) on purchases. Between payment and confirmation\nbetween clearing houses\nbetween instructions through agents\nfrom confirmation of receipt of cash in payment CR - FICC Derivatives FRAs Market replacement risk\nDue to counterparty credit risk (counterparty defaults/fails before settlement) i) a market replacement cost, a substitute FRA arranged at an unfavourable rate judged against the original transaction.\nii) if a replacement FRA cannot be arranged, full exposure to any adverse movements in interest rates against which the original FRA was initiated. relates to vol of IR in cash market assessed daily on MtM basis\n(a negative market to market, i.e. the bank owes the counterparty = nil risk). Some banks may still assess risk on FRAs as a flat percentage (i.e. 5% maximum potential interest rate swing in any period where there is an FRA outstanding). Financial Futures (STIR contracts) NO CREDIT RISK This is because of the Exchange of Clearing House Where the CH becomes buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer Because of the total lack of credit risk, Financial Futures are the only financial trading product which is not subject to Capital Adequacy requirements. IRS (including OIS) Have credit risk on the counterparty, reflects market replacement risk (and costs associated)\nMarket replacement risk If the counterparty defaults during life of the swap, the bank will be left with their position which may be covered at a loss. Position could be in foreign exchange positions or interest rate positions\nSwaps should be MtM on regular basis to reflect market replacement risk and effected preferably daily.\nCounterparties aren't usually aware of each other's identities bank assumes credit risk of each counterparty unless acts as just a broker Given the long term nature of swaps banks must pay greater attention to increased risk the longer the period remaining to maturity of any transaction. Many banks use a sliding scale to assess credit risk on swaps based on historic analysis of movements in interest rates. Further percentage credit utilisation measures may be applied where the currenc(ies) involved are not traded in the major international markets.\nCurrency and IR swaps are subject to exchange rate volatility which can lead to a higher replacement cost on default\nFactors affecting credit risk Overall level of interest rates\nCollateral\nReset frequency more frequent, easy to identify if counterparty will default Shape of yield curve if currently positive then the probability is that floating rates will rise meaning that the floating rate payer (fixed rate receiver)’s liability will increase in the future. Delivery risk - IRS risks rise when: i) dates of receipts and payments of fixed and floating interest flows may differ and the counterparty fails to make a payment after receiving funds from the bank\nii) a counterparty accepts payment to it but fails to make payment to the bank on the same day. This risk applies mainly to currency swaps since payments in the same currency on an interest rate swap are usually netted.\niii) in respect of currency swaps, the final exchange of currencies at an exchange rate agreed several years previously could lead to substantial exchange exposure CR Mitigation Some ways are netting and collateral otherwise credit derivatives Credit Derivatives A credit derivative is another means of credit mitigation allowing the lender to effectively transfer risk of a debtor defaulting to a third party. This third party, as in insurance policy accepts some or all the risk in return for payment, known as the premium.\nCDS definition: A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial derivative whereby an investor \"swaps\" or offsets his credit risk in a bilateral OTC contract with another investor. If lender is concerned their counterparty will default, they can enter a CDS with someone else (transferring the credit risk to an insurer at a premium)\nThe lender buys a CDS from 3rd party who then agrees to reimburse the lender should their counterparty (borrower) default\nDifferent parties: Lender/Borrower\nBuyer/Seller\nThe Lender (A) of the security/loan/etc. is the one at risk to the borrower (B) (counterparty) and would be the one to buy the CDS (therefore be the buyer)\nthe Seller (C) is therefore the 3rd party and the insurer\nA = Lender and Buyer\nB = Borrower\nC = Seller and Insurer\nA buys CDS from C to protect from B defaulting TRS A Total return swap is a swap which permits a counterparty (receiver) to achieve the risk and return on an asset without actually owning it. In exchange this party must pay an agreed rate (fixed, floating or variable) over the life of the swap. The receiver assumes the credit risk, whereas the payer takes on the credit exposure the receiver may be subject to. An example is USD floating rate v. S&amp;P 500 index on an agreed investment amount.\n<br>Own Note: <a data-href=\"Total Return Swap (TRS)\" href=\"total-return-swap-(trs).html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Total Return Swap (TRS)</a> CDO Structured like with tranches\nBased on pool of cash loans/other assets and then sold to investors\nBecomes collateral if loan defaults (Big Short) CVA Credit Value Adjustment is the difference between the risk-free portfolio value and the true (mark to market) portfolio value that takes into account the possibility of a counterparty’s default. CVA is the market value of counterparty credit risk. Documentation Cash Markets (i.e. FX and MM) have \"My word is my bond\" don't have enough documentation. So in last few years have gathered standard terms and conditions governing each of these instruments especially with rise of derivatives in OTC markets FXC cover close-out netting provisions and transaction payments legal terms\nFEOMA (1997)\nIFEMA exchange transactions ICOM Master Agreement currency option transactions IFXCO Master Agreement updates others by including FX and currency options definitions according to Global Documentation Steering Committee FEOMA combines IFEMA and ICOM Master agreements GMRA global master repurchase agreement\nfor repos\nPublished by International Capital Market Association (ICMA)\nwhich is the body representing the cross-border bond and repo markets in Europe\npublished by PSA (Public Securities Association) now TBMA (The Bond Market Association)\ngood for classic repos\npre-sign GMRA then transactions are referred back to bi-lateral agreement sets out procedures for margining\nevents of default\nalso range of definitions of terminology ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreements\n1992\nCovers all rates market derivative products.\n2 types: local Multi-currency cross-border A Credit Support Annex is a legal document which regulates the collateral used in Derivative transactions. It is one of the four parts that make up an ISDA Master Agreement but is not mandatory. ISDA Credit Support Annex (CSA) defines terms under which collateral is posted / transferred between swap counterparties to mitigate credit risk coming from \"in the money\" derivative positions\nIf on any Valuation Date, the Delivery Amount equals or exceeds the Pledgor's Minimum Transfer Amount, the Pledgor must transfer Eligible Collateral with a Value at least equal to the Delivery Amount. The Delivery Amount is the amount the Credit Support Amount exceeds the Value of all posted Collateral held by the Secured Party. The Collateral must meet the Eligibility criteria in the agreement, e.g., which currencies it may be in, what types of bonds are allowed, and which, if any, haircuts are applied. There are also rules for the settlement of disputes arising over valuation of derivative positions.\nTo distinguish between the Schedule to the Master Agreement and the Credit Support Annex, the schedules are numbered as Parts and CSA are numbered as Paragraphs.\nUnder English Law, CSA are considered transactions: Any collateral listed as ‘Eligible Collateral’ is delivered as an outright transfer of title. The collateral taker becomes the outright owner of that collateral free of any third party interest.\nAn English law credit support annex operates by way of outright transfers of title to the posted collateral whereas parties transacting business under a New York CSA can materially change the parties’ rights and obligations and their standing upon an insolvency of the other party giving rise to Legal risk. (See later in this chapter). Operational Risk Definition In 2004 the Basel Committee initially defined Operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. The committee indicates that this definition excludes systemic risk, legal risk and reputational risk\nAfter downfall of big companies regulators decided to focus on risks other than Credit Risk and Market Risk Includes: employee errors, (e.g. fat-finger trading errors, reconciliation failings)\nmodel mis-use or mal-functions, (e.g. incorrect or erroneously programmed algorithms)\ncommunication failures, (e.g. telephone, lack of rates information, trading platform outages etc.)\nIT systems failures, (e.g. in-house systems problems - processing and/or reporting)\nfire, floods or other losses to physical assets,\nfraud or other criminal activity (including rogue trading) Legal Risk Legal risk is risk from uncertainty due to legal actions or uncertainty in the applicability or interpretation of contracts, laws or regulations. Depending on an institution's circumstances, legal risk may entail such issues as Contract formation i.e. what constitutes a legitimate contract? Is an oral agreement sufficient, or must there be a legal document? What documentation is required? Does a counterparty have the capacity to enter into a transaction?\nIf transacting across borders, subject to more jurisdictions and risk on who becomes the authority over a legal issue Reputational Risk Based on trust\nTakes forever to build, can be lost instantly\nLoss of confidence by any group of market counterparties can quickly lead to the decline of a bank with credit lines reduced or withdrawn making the bank’s funding more difficult or more expensive.\nReputational risk management is supported by \"the plans, processes and practices, which engender and sustain the trust of all and each category of market counterparties\". Other risks Specific Risk (\"unsystematic risk\") In a balanced portfolio of assets there'd be a spread between general market risk and risks specific to individual components of that portfolio. Determination of the extent of exposure to individual risks is made using models such as Treynor-Black in which the optimal share of a security is inversely proportional to the square of its specific risk. Systemic Risk Systemic risk is a means to describe the likelihood of the collapse of a financial system, such as a general stock market crash or a joint breakdown of the banking system.\nSystemic risk != systematic risk Systematic risk = whole economy like business cycles or wars SIFI Systematically Important Financial Institution bank/insurance company or fin institution which failure might cause a crisis\n\"too big to fail\" Wrong way risk defined by ISDA as the risk that occurs when \"exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty\nWhen default risk and credit exposure increase together\nOrdinarily in trading book credit risk measurement, the creditworthiness of the counterparty and the exposure of a transaction are measured and modelled independently. An example of wrong way risk is where credit derivatives are being used to protect against counterparty default the counterparty’s subsequent default impacts the creditworthiness of the seller of the credit insurance (derivative). Basel Accords (Basel I to Basel III) Basel I is a set of international banking regulations put forward by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision that sets out the minimum capital requirements of financial institutions with the goal of minimizing credit risk\nG10 got together\nStarted with Cooke Ratio\nTogether are called \"Basel Accords\"\nBasel III recommendations were originally scheduled to be introduced from 2013 until 2015; however, implementation was extended repeatedly to 31st March 2019 and then again until 1st January 2022.\nTiers Tier 1 Tier 1 Capital (“core” capital) consists of equity and disclosed reserves.\nSecure capital to absorb losses in case of defaults so it gets absorbed by the reserve instead of earnings Tier 2 Tier 2 Capital (“supplementary” capital) includes perpetual securities, undisclosed reserves, subordinated debt over 5 years to maturity and shares redeemable at the option of the issuer. BIS ratio Of the BIS Ratio for Capital cover of 8 percent at least 50 percent must be Tier 1 Capital. All classes of assets are risk weighted according to asset classes and counterparty (OECD government to non-OECD non financial counterparty). As the perceived credit risk increases so too does the risk weighting. Trading Book 3 criteria: that the instrument is a financial instrument\n…and that the instrument is held for trading purposes\n…or that the instrument is hedging an exposure in the trading book. Instruments included: transferable securities,\nmoney market instruments,\nfinancial futures contracts,\nFRAs,\ninterest rate swaps,\ncurrency swaps\nand options to acquire these instruments. Definition: proprietary positions in financial instruments which are held for resale and/or which are taken on by the institution with the intention of benefiting in the short term from actual and/or expected differences between their buying and selling prices or positions taken in order to hedge other elements of the trading book\nexposures due to the unsettled transactions, free deliveries and OTC derivative instruments, exposures due to repurchase agreements (Repos) and securities lending\nthose exposures in the form of fees, commission, interest, dividends and margin on exchange traded derivatives In the UK, positions are considered to be held with a trading intent if:.. they are marked to market daily as part of the internal risk management process - the position takers have autonomy in entering into transactions within predetermined limits\nthey satisfy any other criteria which the bank applies to the composition of its trading book on a consistent basis. CAD II CAD II is the EU directive that allows financial institutions to use internal VaR models to calculate market risk capital requirements in line with BIS Basel standards. Banks must measure Delta, Gamma and Vega risk when calculating Capital adequacy required against written (Sold) Options positions. VAR is an acceptable measure of risk for assessment of BIS capital adequacy calculations and other central bank imposed risk measures.\nCan also choose SA\nLays down basic standards for in-house (IM) models The model must express a VaR estimate to a 99% confidence level, must calculate losses on the basis of a 10 day holding period and all historic data used must cover at least the last 12 months Basel II differences Brought in 3 pillars\nmore reflective of underlying risks in banking.\nBetter incentives\nBuilt on the previous one to point to risks that banks actually face This was achieved in part by aligning capital requirements more closely to the risk of credit loss and by introducing a new capital charge for exposures to the risk of loss caused by operational failures. Pillars Summary: Pillar I -&gt; Minimum Capital Requirements\nPillar II -&gt; Supervisory Review\nPillar III -&gt; Market Discipline Pillar I - Minimum capital requirements Pillar I presents the calculation of the total minimum capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk\nThe capital ratio is calculated using the definition of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets. The total capital ratio must be no lower than 8%. Tier 2 capital is limited to 100% of Tier 1 capital.\nDefinition of \"Eligible Capital\" is still the same as Basel I\nUnder the standardised approach to credit risk, general provisions can be included in Tier 2 capital subject to the limit of 1.25% of risk weighted assets. Under the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, the treatment of the 1988 Accord to include general provisions (or general loan-loss reserves) in Tier 2 capital is withdrawn. The definition of Tier 3 capital as set out in the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (January 1996, modified September 1997, in this Framework referred to as the Market Risk Amendment) remains unchanged. Basel III Basel III, the global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk agreed upon by members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2010 was developed in response to the deficiencies in financial regulation revealed by the 2008 financial crisis. Basel III strengthens bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage.\nDefinitions and calculations: B III - Pillar 1: aligns minimum capital requirements more closely to each bank's actual risk of economic loss\nRisk-weighted assets under Basel II / III Total risk-weighted assets under Basel II are determined by multiplying the capital requirements for market risk and operational risk by 12.5 (i.e. the reciprocal of the minimum capital ratio of 8%) and adding the resulting figures to the sum of risk-weighted assets for credit risk. Pillar II - Supervisory Review Pillar II covers the key principles of supervisory review, risk management, guidance and supervisory transparency and accountability produced by BIS with respect to banking risks, including guidance relating to, among other things, the treatment of interest rate risk in the banking book, credit risk (stress testing, definition of default, residual risk, and credit concentration risk), operational risk, enhanced cross-border communication and cooperation, and securitisation\nEnsures banks are better developing and using better risk management techniques to monitor and manage their risks\nSupervisors must evaluate how banks are assessing their capital based on their needs and risks and must know when to intervene\ncan't just rely on capital reserves, also need internal risk limits and controls\nThere are three main areas that might be particularly suited to treatment under Pillar II, risks considered under Pillar I that are not fully captured by the Pillar I process (e.g. credit concentration risk); those factors not taken into account by the Pillar I process (e.g. interest rate risk in the banking book, business and strategic risk); and factors external to the bank (e.g. business cycle effects).\nA further important aspect of Pillar II is the assessment of compliance with the minimum standards and disclosure requirements of the more advanced methods in Pillar I, in particular the IRB framework for credit risk and the Advanced Measurement Approaches for operational risk.\nSupervisors must ensure that these requirements are met, both as qualifying criteria and on a continuing basis.\nUnder Basel III - Pillar II bank supervisors must evaluate the activities and risk profiles of individual banks to determine whether those organisations should hold higher levels of capital than the minimum requirements in Pillar 1 would specify and to see whether there is any need for remedial actions. Pillar III - Market Discipline The rationale for Pillar III is sufficiently strong to warrant the introduction of disclosure requirements for banks using the Framework. Supervisors have an array of measures that they can use to require banks to make such disclosures. Some of these disclosures will be qualifying criteria for the use of particular methodologies or the recognition of particular instruments and transactions\nComplements Pillar I and Pillar II\nencourages market discipline with disclosure requirements\nallows market participants to assess key pieces of information on: the scope of application\ncapital\nrisk exposures\nrisk assessment processes\nand hence the capital adequacy of the institution BIS believes it's an effective way of getting each bank to inform the market of their exposure to those risks and allows for transparency and comparability\nBasel III, Pillar 3 leverages the ability of market discipline to motivate prudent management by enhancing the degree of transparency in banks’ public reporting to shareholders and customers. Probability of Default (PD) Probability of default (PD) is the likelihood of a default over a particular time horizon.\nUnder Basel II: a default event on a debt obligation is said to have occurred if... it is unlikely that the obligor will be able to repay its debt to the bank without giving up any pledged collateral\nthe obligor is more than 90 days past due on a material credit obligation The PD is an estimate of the likelihood that the default event will occur over a fixed assessment horizon, usually taken to be one year. The PD can be estimated for a particular obligor which is the usual practice in wholesale banking, or for a segment of obligors sharing similar credit risk characteristics which is the usual practice in retail banking. Exposure at Default (EAD) Exposure at Default is an estimate of the extent to which a bank may be exposed to a counterparty in the event of, and at the time of, that counterparty’s default. EAD is equal to the current amount outstanding in case of fixed exposures like term loans. For revolving exposures like lines of credit, EAD can be divided into drawn and undrawn commitments.\nBased on Basel II: EAD measures the amount that is likely to be drawn further if a default occurs.\n2 terms for this are used (how expressed): Conversion Factor (CF)\nLoan Equivalent (LEQ) While under foundation approach (F-IRB) calculation of EAD is guided by the regulators, under the advanced approach (A-IRB) banks enjoy greater flexibility on how they calculate EAD.\nCalculation Under Foundation Approach (F-IRB) Under F-IRB EAD is calculated taking account of the underlying asset, forward valuation, facility type and commitment details. This value does not take account of guarantees, collateral or security (i.e. it ignores Credit Risk mitigation techniques with the exception of on-balance sheet netting where the effect of netting is included in Exposure at Default).\nFor on-balance sheet transactions, EAD is identical to the nominal amount of exposure. On-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits of a bank to a corporate counterparty is permitted to reduce the estimate of EAD under certain conditions.\nFor off-balance sheet items, there are two broad types which the IRB approach needs to address: transactions with uncertain future drawdown, such as commitments and revolving credits, and OTC foreign exchange, interest rate and equity derivative contracts Calculation Under Advanced Approach (A-IRB) Under A-IRB, the bank itself determines the appropriate EAD to be applied to each exposure.\n(Internal EAD estimates)\nA bank using internal EAD estimates for capital purposes is able to differentiate EAD values on the basis of a wider set of transaction characteristics (e.g. product type) as well as borrower characteristics. These values would be expected to represent a conservative view of long-run averages, although banks are free to use more conservative estimates.\nA bank wishing to use its own estimates of EAD will need to demonstrate to its local Central Bank / regulator that it can meet additional minimum requirements pertinent to the integrity and reliability of these estimates.\nAll estimates of EAD are calculated net of any specific provisions a bank may have raised against an exposure. Loss given default (LGD) Definition: Loss Given Default is percentage of loss over the total exposure when bank's counterparty goes to default\nIt is facility-specific because such losses are generally understood to be influenced by key transaction characteristics: such as the presence of collateral\nand the degree of subordination. Theoretically, LGD is calculated in different ways, 'Gross' LGD, the favourite with academics, where total losses are divided by exposure at default (EAD)\nor ‘Blanco’ LGD, preferred by banks because they have many secured facilities and would like to decompose their losses between losses on unsecured portions and losses on secured portions due to depreciation of collateral quality. Capital Treatment of Credit Risk under Basel II and III 3 approaches to credit risk under BII. The SA is simplest of the 3. The other 2 are based on internal ratings (IM)\nStandardised Approach SA avoids complexity\nRisk Weights Risk weighted assets under the Standardised Approach will continue to be calculated as the product of the amount of exposures and supervisory determined risk weight\nAs in the current Accord the risk weights will be determined by the category of the borrower, sovereign bank or corporate counterparty. There is now no distinction on the sovereign risk weighting depending on whether or not the sovereign is a member of OECD under Basel III. Basel III - Summary of changes from previous versions (earlier Accords) Minimum common equity requirement of 2% to 4.5%\nCapital conservation buffer 2.5% - met with common equity. If under then there are greater constraints on earnings distributions are imposed\nTotal common equity requirement is 7%\nHigher capital requirements for trading, derivatives and securitization\nTier 1 capital from 4% to 6% over the same period\nCountercyclical buffer in the range of 0 to 2.5% of common equity according to national circumstances\nIntroduction of Liquidity coverage ratio (LCD)\nIntroduction of Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\nSupplemented by non risk based leverage ratio Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) The purpose of the ICAAP document is to inform the Board of an institution of the ongoing assessment of the firm’s risks, how the firm intends to mitigate those risks and how much current and future capital is necessary having considered other mitigating factors. The ICAAP document is also how the firm explains to the UK’s PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority) or its local regulator its internal capital adequacy assessment process.

Interest Arbitrage Interest arbitrage is the link between the Eurocurrency money markets via the forward exchange market\nIn such a currency, consider the situation where a bank dealer has quoted and dealt with a corporate customer on an outright basis and subsequently covered the currency exposure by a reverse spot operation. If there are no means available to cover the resultant forward exchange time position via a foreign exchange swap transaction, or exchange controls prohibit it, the mismatched currency cashflows can be squared by a liability in one and an asset in the other currency for the period in question. The initial spot and forward outright deals must in this case be identified together as a swap and treated as interest arbitrage.\ne.g. dealer looking for funding of EUR asset by taking USD deposit uses the forward EUR/USD market in a 'covered' IR situation forward swap points are equivalent to difference in the interest rates in the two currencies concerned for the period quoted.\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250328124930.png\" src=\"resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250328124930.png\" target=\"_self\"> because of what we said above, forward points are the difference in interest rates in the currencies\ncan calculate swap points\nmaximum funding rate possible\nor minimum asset return necessary to reach equilibrium (no profit no loss 'break-even' rate) <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250328130047.png\" src=\"resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250328130047.png\" target=\"_self\"> Market user funds this FX swap by buying EUR spot and selling 6m forward EUR (180 days) against USD on the 6m swap price using those quotes from the market maker. 54 - 59\nIt's \"his favour\" so he's buying at the lower price.\nBuying spot and selling forward EUR (BID)\n<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250328130238.png\" src=\"resources/attachments/pasted-image-20250328130238.png\" target=\"_self\">\nremember swap is simultaneous exchange of currencies (at spot/at fwd) so buys and sells EUR / sells and buys USD what you buy (EUR) will be the fixed amount. the counter currency amount (USD) is what changes based on the exchange rate. i.e. how many USD can you get for the EUR\nNext part is the deposit\nfunds the 6m USD cash requirement with a matching USD deposit The 6 months (180 days) USD Money market rate is currently quoted: 2.88 - 2.988361 p.c.\nThe funding dealer takes a six months deposit in the amount of USD 13,850,000.00 (the exact Spot date cash requirement) at the offered rate of 2. 988361 p.c.

In accounting and financial reporting, assets, liabilities, and commitments can be classified as on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet depending on whether they are recorded on a company's financial statements.These are assets and liabilities that appear directly on the balance sheet because the company has ownership, control, or direct financial exposure.\nCash and Cash Equivalents – Physical cash, bank deposits, and highly liquid short-term investments.\nLoans and Advances – Loans issued by banks and financial institutions.\nSecurities – Bonds, equities, and other marketable investments owned by the entity.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) – Physical assets used in business operations.\nInventory – Goods held for sale or production. Deposits – Customer funds held by a bank.\nBorrowings – Short-term and long-term debt obligations.\nTrade Payables – Money owed to suppliers.\nBond Issuances – Debt securities issued to investors. Recognized in financial statements.\nDirectly affects financial ratios, leverage, and regulatory capital requirements.\nThese are financial commitments, contingent liabilities, or assets not recorded on the balance sheet because they do not represent a direct obligation or ownership at the time of reporting.

Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) – Agreements to exchange interest rate cash flows, with no principal recorded on the balance sheet.\nCurrency Forwards &amp; Options – Used for FX hedging, with only changes in value reflected in financial statements.\nCredit Default Swaps (CDS) – Insurance-like derivatives on credit events, recorded off-balance sheet until exercised. Securitized Loans (Mortgage-Backed Securities, MBS) – Banks package and sell loans to investors, removing them from the balance sheet.\nLeasing Arrangements (Operating Leases) – Previously off-balance sheet (before IFRS 16), meaning companies used leased assets without recording them as liabilities. Not recognized as direct assets or liabilities but can create future obligations.\nUsed to manage risk, improve financial ratios, or comply with regulatory requirements. On-Balance Sheet items include assets and liabilities that a company owns or owes directly and are fully recorded in financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet items involve potential obligations, contingent liabilities, or transferred risks that are not fully recognized but still impact financial health and risk exposure.\nFinancial institutions use off-balance sheet transactions to manage risk, optimize capital efficiency, and meet regulatory requirements while keeping certain exposures out of core financial statements.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"ChatGPT","level":1,"id":"ChatGPT_0"},{"heading":"<strong>On-Balance Sheet vs. Off-Balance Sheet Items</strong>","level":3,"id":"**On-Balance_Sheet_vs._Off-Balance_Sheet_Items**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>1.

Banks and pension funds use duration matching to minimize interest rate risk.\nDuration gap measures mismatch between asset and liability durations. Regulators (Basel III) require banks to monitor duration risk.\nHedging strategies use duration-based derivatives (e.g., interest rate swaps). Macaulay Duration helps measure time-weighted cash flows.\nModified Duration provides an estimate of price sensitivity.\nEffective Duration is used when bonds have optionality.\nDuration is essential for pricing, reporting, and interest rate risk management. Duration is a NPV of cash flows which are time weighted.\nDuration can be used to rank bonds’ price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It can be used as a tool for managing interest rate risk. Duration is the weighted average cash flow of a bond, where the present values of the cash flows serve as the weights adjusted by time. Duration is the future point in TIME at which, on average, the investor has received exactly half of the original investment in PV terms.\nModified Duration: defined as “the percentage change in a bond’s dirty price for a 1 p.c. change in yield”\nModified Duration is an estimate of the bond’s price sensitivity to changes in yield.\nActs as a multiplier\n\"Price acceleration or deceleration\" Effective duration: used instead of modified duration because the presence of prepayments changes the level of cash flow (seldom the case in wholesale market transactions). Modified duration assumes constant cash flow.\nAs market yields rise, effective duration lengthens and price declines accelerate compared with what is implied by the instrument’s modified duration.

Below is a detailed explanation of how these dates function for various instruments, as per the ACI syllabus.\nDefinition: The date on which a financial transaction (e.g., spot, forward, bond purchase) is agreed upon between counterparties.\nPurpose: It marks the beginning of the transaction lifecycle.\nApplication Across Instruments: FX: The trade date is when the parties agree to exchange currencies.\nBonds: The trade date is when the bond buyer and seller agree on the terms (e.g., price, yield).\nDerivatives: The trade date initiates the derivative contract (e.g., futures or swaps). Definition: The date when the cash or securities involved in a transaction are exchanged and settled.\nPurpose: Indicates when the transaction is finalized and becomes effective.\nApplication Across Instruments: FX Spot: The value date is typically T+2 (two business days after the trade date).\nFX Forward: The value date is agreed upon and corresponds to the forward tenor (e.g., 1 month, 3 months, etc.).\nMoney Market Instruments: The value date is usually T+0, T+1, or T+2, depending on the market convention.\nBonds: The value date is when ownership of the bond is transferred, typically T+2. Definition: The standard settlement date for a spot transaction, typically T+2 in most financial markets.\nPurpose: Used as the starting point for calculating forward dates.\nApplication Across Instruments: FX Spot: For most currency pairs, the spot date is two business days after the trade date (T+2), except for pairs like USD/CAD and USD/TRY, which settle on T+1.\nBonds and Equities: Spot date aligns with the market's settlement convention (commonly T+2).\nCommodities: Spot settlement depends on the commodity exchange’s rules. Definition: A value date beyond the spot date, agreed upon for forward transactions.\nPurpose: Specifies when the transaction will settle in the future.\nApplication Across Instruments: FX Forward: The forward date is derived from the spot date by adding the agreed tenor (e.g., 1 month, 3 months).\nInterest Rate Swaps: The forward start date defines when the interest payments or obligations begin.\nForward Rate Agreements (FRAs): The forward date is when the notional interest period begins. Definition: The date on which a financial instrument expires or the principal amount is repaid.\nPurpose: Represents the end of the transaction lifecycle.\nApplication Across Instruments: FX Forward/Swaps: The maturity date is when the final exchange of currencies takes place.\nBonds: The maturity date is when the bondholder receives the principal and last coupon payment.\nMoney Market Instruments: Maturity corresponds to the date when the issuer repays the loan (e.g., certificates of deposit, treasury bills).\nDerivatives: Futures or options contracts mature on pre-determined dates. Definition: The date when the actual transfer of cash, securities, or other assets occurs.\nPurpose: Ensures that all parties fulfill their contractual obligations.\nApplication Across Instruments: FX: Settlement occurs on the value date when the agreed currencies are exchanged.\nBonds and Equities: Settlement typically occurs on T+2 or T+1, depending on the market.\nCommodities: Settlement happens when the physical commodity or cash equivalent is delivered. Spot Transaction: Trade Date: Monday, 1st February 2025\nSpot Date: Wednesday, 3rd February 2025 (T+2)\nValue Date: Same as the spot date (3rd February 2025). 1-Month Forward: Trade Date: Monday, 1st February 2025\nSpot Date: Wednesday, 3rd February 2025\nValue Date (Forward Date): Monday, 3rd March 2025 (1 month from the spot date).

It is used across various financial markets to describe the time period for which money is lent, borrowed, or invested. Time Frame: A tenor specifies the duration of a contract or financial instrument, such as 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, or longer.\nIt is expressed in terms of days, months, or years. Instruments Where Tenor Applies: Foreign Exchange (FX): For forward contracts, the tenor defines the time period beyond the spot date (e.g., 1 month forward).\nMoney Market Instruments: Tenor defines the duration of instruments like certificates of deposit, treasury bills, or repos.\nLoans &amp; Bonds: In loans or fixed-income securities, tenor refers to the time remaining until the principal is repaid.\nDerivatives: Tenor determines the lifespan of a futures or options contract or an interest rate swap. Spot vs. Forward Tenor: Spot Tenor: Usually T+2 (two business days) in FX markets.\nForward Tenor: A specific period added to the spot date, such as 1 week, 1 month, or 1 year. Maturity and Tenor Relationship: The maturity date is the date on which the tenor ends.\nFor example, if a bond is issued with a 5-year tenor on 1st January 2025, it will mature on 1st January 2030. Foreign Exchange (FX): Spot Transaction: Has a standard tenor of 2 business days (T+2).\nForward Contracts: A tenor of 1 month, 3 months, or any agreed period beyond T+2. Money Market Instruments: A 90-day certificate of deposit has a tenor of 90 days from issuance.\nA 7-day repo agreement has a tenor of 7 days. Bonds: A 10-year bond issued today has a tenor of 10 years, but after 2 years, its remaining tenor will be 8 years. Derivatives (Interest Rate Swaps): An interest rate swap with a tenor of 5 years implies payments and settlements will occur periodically for 5 years. Pricing: Tenor impacts the pricing of financial instruments. For example: Longer tenors typically involve greater uncertainty, resulting in higher yields or premiums.\nShorter tenors often attract lower yields due to reduced risk. Liquidity: Instruments with shorter tenors tend to have higher liquidity since they mature quickly. Risk Management: The tenor affects exposure to credit risk, interest rate risk, and market risk.\nLonger tenors generally involve higher risks because they extend over a longer period.

Below is a comprehensive table summarizing the key dates to take into account for various financial instruments, as covered in the ACI syllabus: Trade Date (T): The date on which the transaction is agreed between parties.\nApplies universally to all instruments. Spot Date: The standard settlement date for spot transactions, typically T+2 in most markets.\nNot relevant for all instruments (e.g., options or FRAs). Value Date: The date when cash flows, securities, or commodities are exchanged.\nFor FX and bonds, this typically coincides with the spot date or forward date. Maturity Date: The end date of the instrument or contract, when principal or final obligations are settled.\nApplies to bonds, loans, forwards, swaps, and other instruments. Settlement Date: The date on which the actual transfer of assets (e.g., cash or securities) occurs.\nFor spot transactions, this is typically the same as the value date. Other Dates: Coupon Payment Dates: For bonds, these are pre-specified dates on which interest payments are made.\nExpiry Date: The final date for options or futures contracts.\nFixing Date: For FRAs or swaps, the date when the interest rate is determined. If you'd like more detail on specific instruments or examples, let me know!what is deal date?<br><img alt=\"GPT Icon\" src=\"https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/content?id=file-9R3AIb2mcnxSDS1yiicMxTcn&amp;gizmo_id=g-KKBgd8GXb&amp;ts=482742&amp;p=gpp&amp;sig=de97c696f75edfd96dcb2a16162370aae278acc1db5ba5bb0742920cf70b7dd7&amp;v=0\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer\" target=\"_self\" class=\"is-unresolved\">The deal date is the same as the trade date—it refers to the date on which a financial transaction is agreed upon between two counterparties. This is the starting point of the transaction lifecycle, marking the day when the terms of the trade (e.g., price, amount, tenor, value date, etc.) are finalized. Initiation of the Trade: The deal date is the day on which the parties enter into an agreement for a transaction, such as an FX trade, bond purchase, money market deposit, or derivative contract. Time of Agreement: The actual time of the deal within the day is important for determining whether it falls into the current business day or rolls over to the next (based on market cutoff times). Basis for Other Dates: Other dates, such as the spot date, value date, and maturity date, are calculated based on the deal date. It serves as the reference point for calculating other dates, such as the spot date, value date, and maturity date.\nIt is a record-keeping marker, as financial transactions must be recorded based on the date the trade is struck.\nIt determines cutoff times for a transaction, as trades executed after a market's cutoff time are assigned the next business day as the deal date. Deal Date: Monday, 5th February 2025.\nSpot Date: Wednesday, 7th February 2025 (T+2 from the deal date).\nValue Date: Same as the spot date: 7th February 2025.\nLet me know if you'd like clarification on any specific scenarios!","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"ACI","level":1,"id":"ACI_0"},{"heading":"Spot Date","level":2,"id":"Spot_Date_0"},{"heading":"ChatGPT","level":1,"id":"ChatGPT_0"},{"heading":"ChatGPT said:","level":6,"id":"ChatGPT_said_0"},{"heading":"1.

Here is a breakdown of each:\nDefinition: A forward contract (or forward agreement) is a customized agreement between two parties to buy or sell an underlying asset (which can be a currency, commodity, or financial instrument) at a specified future date for a price agreed upon today.\nKey Characteristics: Customizable: Terms (like contract size, settlement dates, and asset type) can be tailored to the needs of the contracting parties.\nOver-the-Counter (OTC): These contracts are traded privately between two parties, typically not involving an exchange.\nSettlement: The contract is typically settled at the maturity date, and delivery of the underlying asset may occur, or it may be settled in cash.\nRisk: There is counterparty risk because the contract is not standardized or centrally cleared. Definition: A Forward Rate Agreement is a specific type of forward contract where the underlying asset is an interest rate. An FRA is an agreement between two parties to exchange interest payments based on a notional principal at a future date.\nKey Characteristics: Interest Rate Focus: Unlike forwards which may involve various types of assets, FRAs specifically deal with interest rates (usually on short-term lending or borrowing).\nCash Settlement: FRAs are typically settled in cash, based on the difference between the agreed-upon interest rate and the market rate at the settlement time.\nOver-the-Counter (OTC): Like forwards, FRAs are negotiated directly between two parties and are not standardized or traded on exchanges.\nCommon Usage: Often used by banks, corporations, and investors to hedge or speculate on interest rate movements. Definition: A futures contract is a standardized agreement traded on an exchange to buy or sell an underlying asset at a future date, at a price agreed upon today.\nKey Characteristics: Standardized: The terms of futures contracts (such as contract size, expiration date, and settlement procedures) are standardized by the exchange, meaning they are the same for all participants.\nExchange-Traded: Futures contracts are traded on organized exchanges such as the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange), which ensures liquidity and transparency.\nDaily Settlement: Futures contracts are marked-to-market daily, meaning that profits and losses are settled every day, and margin accounts are adjusted accordingly.\nLower Counterparty Risk: Futures contracts are cleared by a central clearinghouse, which significantly reduces counterparty risk.\nHighly Liquid: Due to the standardization and exchange-trading, futures contracts generally have higher liquidity compared to forwards and FRAs. Forward Contracts are customizable agreements typically used in OTC markets for a wide range of assets.\nFRAs are a specific type of forward contract used primarily for hedging or speculating on interest rate changes.\nFutures Contracts are standardized contracts traded on exchanges with daily settlement and lower counterparty risk, providing high liquidity.\nEach of these instruments serves distinct purposes based on the level of customization required, the asset type involved, and the risk profile of the parties involved.See <a data-href=\"2025-03-26_04-59 FX Summary\" href=\"2025-03-26_04-59-fx-summary.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">2025-03-26_04-59 FX Summary</a>\nantes\nbuy sell at future time\nantes / short dated\nspot against forward 3v6s\ndeals on spot but commences from forward date<br>\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"ACI Textbook1.pdf > page=160&amp;selection=148,0,149,1\" data-href=\"ACI Textbook1.pdf#page=160&amp;selection=148,0,149,1\" href=\"resources/attachments/aci-textbook1.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">ACI Textbook1, page 160</a>\n","aliases":["Forward Forwards","Forward Rate Agreements","Differences between FRAs, Futures and Forwards","Futures","Forward/Forward swaps"],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"1.

Intermediate goods (already included in final product value).\nNon-market transactions (household work, volunteer services).\nUnderground economy (illegal activities, unreported transactions).\nSecond-hand goods (only new production counts).\nFinancial transactions (stocks, bonds, transfer payments). Indicator of economic health: A growing GDP suggests economic expansion, while a shrinking GDP may indicate recession.\nComparison across countries: Helps assess economic performance on a global scale.\nPolicy decision-making: Central banks and governments use GDP data to set monetary and fiscal policies.\nBusiness and investment decisions: Companies analyze GDP trends to make strategic investment choices.\nGNP is the total monetary value of all final goods and services produced by a country’s residents, regardless of location.

No principal amount is exchanged—only the interest differential is settled.Scenario:\nA company expects to take out a 3-month loan of USD 10 million in 2 months. It is concerned that interest rates may rise before the loan starts.Solution:\nThe company buys a 2x5 FRA (an FRA starting in 2 months and lasting for 3 months). This locks in a fixed interest rate for the loan period. If interest rates rise, the FRA compensates the company for the additional borrowing cost. If interest rates fall, the company pays the FRA counterparty but benefits from lower loan costs. Settlement Calculation:\nIf the FRA rate is 3.00% and the actual market rate in 2 months is 3.50%, the company receives the interest difference.

Hedging and Assets and Liabilities","icon":"","description":"To answer your question, we need to break this down into three key concepts:\nWhy Loans Are Considered Assets and Deposits Are Liabilities\nThe Interest Rate Risk from Funding Long-Term Fixed-Rate Assets with Short-Term Liabilities\nHow an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) Helps Hedge the Risk When a bank lends money (e.g., mortgages, corporate loans), it expects to receive interest payments and principal repayment from the borrower. These future cash inflows (interest and principal) represent an economic benefit, which qualifies loans as assets. A fixed-rate loan means the bank earns a fixed interest rate over time. When customers deposit money into a bank (e.g., savings accounts, current accounts), the bank owes this money back to the depositors. This means the bank has an obligation to repay, which makes deposits a liability. If these deposits are short-term (e.g., can be withdrawn anytime or have variable interest rates), the interest rate paid on them can fluctuate with market rates. You own long-term, fixed-rate assets (loans). This means you are earning a fixed interest rate over many years. You fund these loans with short-term, floating-rate liabilities (deposits). This means the interest rate you pay on deposits changes over time. If interest rates increase, the cost of funding (short-term liabilities) rises, but your earnings from fixed-rate loans stay the same. This reduces your profit margin.Example:\nYou gave a 10-year fixed-rate loan at 4% (earning 4%). You funded this loan with short-term deposits at 2% (paying 2%). If deposit rates rise to 3.5%, your funding cost increases, but your loan income remains 4%, reducing your profit margin. This is called a negative interest rate gap, which means rising rates hurt your profitability.To hedge against rising interest rates, you want to receive floating and pay fixed.\nEnter into an interest rate swap (IRS) where you pay fixed and receive floating. This means you will: Pay a fixed rate in the swap (which offsets your fixed loan income). Receive a floating rate in the swap (which helps cover rising deposit costs). This effectively converts your fixed-rate loans into floating-rate loans, matching the floating-rate funding, so your exposure to rising rates is reduced.\nYou should \"buy\" an Interest Rate Swap (IRS), which means you \"pay fixed and receive floating.\" This offsets the risk of rising short-term interest rates increasing your funding costs. ✅ Correct hedge = Buy an IRS = Pay fixed, receive floating.\nLoans are assets because they generate income. Deposits are liabilities because they must be repaid. A mismatch between long-term fixed-rate assets and short-term floating-rate liabilities creates interest rate risk. Hedging with an IRS (pay fixed, receive floating) helps protect against rising interest rates by converting fixed assets to floating.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>Understanding the Relationship Between Loans, Deposits, and Interest Rate Swaps (IRS)</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Understanding_the_Relationship_Between_Loans,_Deposits,_and_Interest_Rate_Swaps_(IRS)**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>1️⃣ Why Are Loans Considered Assets and Deposits Considered Liabilities?</strong>","level":2,"id":"**1️⃣_Why_Are_Loans_Considered_Assets_and_Deposits_Considered_Liabilities?**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Loans = Assets</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Loans_=_Assets**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Deposits = Liabilities</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Deposits_=_Liabilities**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>2️⃣ Interest Rate Risk from Funding Long-Term Fixed-Rate Assets with Short-Term Liabilities</strong>","level":2,"id":"**2️⃣_Interest_Rate_Risk_from_Funding_Long-Term_Fixed-Rate_Assets_with_Short-Term_Liabilities**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Key Risk: Interest Rate Increase</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Key_Risk_Interest_Rate_Increase**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>3️⃣ How an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) Helps Hedge This Risk</strong>","level":2,"id":"**3️⃣_How_an_Interest_Rate_Swap_(IRS)_Helps_Hedge_This_Risk**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Using an IRS to Hedge</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Using_an_IRS_to_Hedge**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Final Answer:</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Final_Answer**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Summary Table: Interest Rate Risks and Solutions</strong>","level":2,"id":"**Summary_Table_Interest_Rate_Risks_and_Solutions**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Conclusion: Why This Strategy Works</strong>","level":2,"id":"**Conclusion_Why_This_Strategy_Works**_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"irs-hedging-and-assets-and-liabilities.html","pathToRoot":".","attachments":[],"createdTime":1744275343306,"modifiedTime":1757925254568,"sourceSize":4350,"sourcePath":"Areas/Finance/IRS Hedging and Assets and Liabilities.md","exportPath":"irs-hedging-and-assets-and-liabilities.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":20,"backlinks":["assets-and-liabilities.html"],"type":"markdown"},"liquidity-and-volatility.html":{"title":"Liquidity and Volatility","icon":"","description":"Volatility is the measure of how drastically a market’s prices change.

These strategies help traders manage exposure to interest rate movements over time.Stripping refers to a strategy where a trader maintains a hedge by using a series of short-term futures contracts instead of a single long-term futures contract. The trader continuously replaces (or \"rolls\") expiring contracts with new ones of shorter maturity.\nInstead of buying or selling a long-dated futures contract, a trader enters into shorter-term futures contracts.\nAs each contract nears expiration, it is closed, and a new contract is entered into for the next available period.\nThis process is repeated continuously. Greater flexibility in adjusting positions based on market conditions.\nLess exposure to long-term interest rate fluctuations. Requires frequent monitoring and transaction costs due to rolling.\nBasis risk may arise if the new contracts are not perfectly aligned with the underlying exposure.\nStacking is a strategy where a trader initially establishes a large position in nearby futures contracts to hedge a longer-term exposure. As time progresses, these contracts are gradually reduced or rolled into new contracts.\nA trader enters into a large number of short-term futures contracts at the beginning.\nAs the hedge period progresses, some contracts are rolled over or closed.\nThe position is gradually adjusted based on market conditions. Provides strong initial hedge protection.\nCan be beneficial in a market with expected interest rate movements. Initial over-hedging may cause excessive risk exposure.\nRequires careful management to adjust positions over time.\nBoth strategies are commonly used in managing interest rate risk with futures, and the choice between them depends on the trader’s risk appetite, market outlook, and hedging objectives.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>1.

Traders and investors use synthetic assets to gain exposure to an asset without direct ownership, often for cost efficiency, hedging, or regulatory reasons.\nA trader can create a synthetic long stock position using options: Buying a call option (right to buy the stock at a certain price). Selling a put option (obligation to buy the stock at a certain price if exercised). This combination replicates the profit/loss profile of owning the stock itself. Instead of holding a foreign currency, a trader can use a foreign exchange forward to synthetically create an exposure. Example: A European investor needs exposure to USD but does not want to convert EUR into USD. The investor enters into a EUR/USD forward contract to receive USD in the future at a fixed exchange rate. This synthetically creates a USD asset without physically holding USD. An institution may use interest rate swaps (IRS) to synthetically create a fixed-rate bond exposure without buying a bond. Example: A bank receives floating-rate payments on an investment but wants fixed income. It enters into a swap where it receives fixed interest and pays floating interest. This creates a synthetic fixed-rate bond. A synthetic liability is a financial position that mimics the risk profile of an actual liability without directly incurring it. Institutions use synthetic liabilities for hedging, funding, and risk management.\nA company in the US needs EUR funding but does not want to take a direct EUR loan. It issues a USD bond and simultaneously enters a USD/EUR currency swap, exchanging USD principal and interest for EUR. This effectively creates a synthetic EUR liability without taking an actual EUR loan. A firm has a floating-rate loan (e.g., LIBOR + 2%) but prefers fixed-rate payments. It enters into an interest rate swap, where it receives floating and pays fixed. This synthetically converts the floating-rate loan into a fixed-rate liability. A company that expects to pay in a foreign currency in the future but does not want immediate exposure to FX risk can short a futures contract in that currency. This effectively creates a synthetic liability in that currency, as if they had borrowed it. Hedging Risk – Avoid direct exposure to currency, interest rate, or equity market fluctuations.\nCost Efficiency – Derivatives and synthetic positions can be cheaper than direct holdings.\nRegulatory Arbitrage – Some institutions use synthetic instruments to comply with capital requirements.\nLiquidity Management – Allows firms to gain or avoid exposure without impacting cash reserves.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>Synthetic Assets and Liabilities: Definition &amp; Examples</strong>","level":3,"id":"**Synthetic_Assets_and_Liabilities_Definition_&_Examples**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>1.

Let’s clarify the differences:\nDefinition: The length of time until a financial instrument, contract, or agreement matures. Common Usage: Refers to the duration of a financial contract (e.g., loans, bonds, swaps, FRAs). In FRAs, a \"6X9 FRA\" has a tenor of 3 months (because it covers the period from 6 months to 9 months). Example: A 5-year bond has a tenor of 5 years. A 3-month interbank deposit has a tenor of 3 months. Definition: A specific time interval within a financial contract or calculation. Common Usage: Used in interest rate calculations, payments, or reset intervals. Can refer to interest compounding periods or coupon payment periods. Example: A floating rate loan with semi-annual interest payments has a 6-month interest period. A quarterly coupon bond has a 3-month period per coupon payment. Definition: The total lifespan or duration of a financial instrument from its start to maturity. Common Usage: Used to describe the entire duration of financial contracts like loans, bonds, and leases. Sometimes used synonymously with tenor, but “term” typically refers to the full duration from issuance rather than the remaining time. Example: A 30-year mortgage has a term of 30 years. A 1-year fixed deposit has a term of 1 year. Term is the total lifespan of a financial instrument.\nTenor is the length of time remaining or specified for a contract.\nPeriod refers to specific intervals within the contract (e.g., interest payment periods).\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong>1.

arising from adverse movements in market variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, equity prices, or commodity prices.Examples:\nInterest Rate Risk: A bondholder experiences losses when interest rates rise, as bond prices fall.\nCurrency Risk (FX Risk): A company with revenue in a foreign currency incurs losses when the home currency strengthens against the foreign currency.\nEquity Risk: A portfolio of stocks decreases in value due to a market-wide downturn.\nDefinition:\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss due to a counterparty's failure to meet its contractual obligations, such as failing to repay a loan or deliver securities.Examples:\nCounterparty Risk: A bank suffers a loss when a borrower defaults on a loan.\nIssuer Risk: An investor holding a corporate bond experiences losses when the issuing company defaults on interest payments.\nDefinition:\nLiquidity risk is the risk of being unable to buy or sell assets quickly enough to prevent a loss or meet obligations due to inadequate market liquidity.Examples:\nMarket Liquidity Risk: An investor holding a large position in a thinly traded bond cannot sell it without significantly impacting its price.\nFunding Liquidity Risk: A bank fails to meet its short-term obligations because it cannot raise funds quickly enough.\nDefinition:\nOperational risk refers to the risk of loss due to failures in internal processes, systems, human errors, or external events.Examples:\nSystem Failure: A trading platform crashes during a high-volume trading session.\nHuman Error: A trader mistakenly enters the wrong trade order, causing financial losses.\nFraud: An employee commits unauthorized transactions, resulting in reputational and financial harm.\nDefinition:\nSettlement risk is the risk that one party in a transaction delivers their obligation (e.g., securities or cash), but the counterparty fails to deliver their side of the transaction.Examples:\nHerstatt Risk: A bank delivers a currency in one time zone but does not receive the counter-currency from the counterparty in another time zone due to their default.\nDefinition:\nInterest rate risk arises from changes in interest rates, which can impact the value of fixed-income instruments or interest-sensitive financial products.Examples:\nA bank holding a portfolio of fixed-rate loans incurs losses when interest rates rise because the loans lose value.\nDefinition:\nFX risk is the risk of losses arising from unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.Examples:\nAn exporter pricing goods in a foreign currency experiences reduced revenue if the foreign currency depreciates against the home currency.\nDefinition:\nBasis risk is the risk that arises from the imperfect correlation between two related instruments or markets used in hedging.Examples:\nA trader hedging an interest rate exposure with a futures contract on a similar but not identical bond faces losses due to the difference in price movements between the two instruments.\nDefinition:\nReputational risk refers to the potential loss of trust or reputation that can harm a firm’s client relationships and financial standing.Examples:\nA bank accused of misconduct or fraud faces customer withdrawals, loss of business, and regulatory fines.\nDefinition:\nLegal risk arises from unenforceable contracts, regulatory penalties, or litigation.Examples:\nA financial institution executes a trade without properly adhering to the legal documentation, resulting in disputes or losses.\nDefinition:\nModel risk occurs when financial models used for pricing, risk assessment, or decision-making are flawed or inaccurate.Examples:\nA pricing model underestimates the risk of a complex derivative, leading to unexpected losses.\nDefinition:\nSovereign risk refers to the risk of a government defaulting on its debt obligations or imposing capital controls that restrict payments.Examples:\nAn investor holding bonds issued by a government faces losses when the government imposes foreign exchange restrictions or fails to make interest payments.\nDefinition:\nPolitical risk is the potential for financial losses due to political instability, regulatory changes, or government actions.Examples:\nAn investment in a foreign country loses value after a government implements nationalization or expropriation policies.\nDefinition:\nRegulatory risk is the risk of losses or operational disruption due to changes in laws, regulations, or supervisory requirements.Examples:\nA bank incurs significant costs to comply with stricter capital requirements imposed by regulators.\nDefinition:\nInflation risk is the risk of purchasing power erosion due to rising prices.Examples:\nAn investor holding a bond with a fixed coupon rate experiences real returns that diminish when inflation rises unexpectedly.\nDefinition:\nEvent risk refers to the financial impact of unexpected, significant events that disrupt markets or institutions.Examples:\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks, or corporate scandals trigger sudden and severe financial losses.\nDefinition:\nThe risk of widespread financial instability caused by the failure of a single large institution or a breakdown in a critical financial market, which can have ripple effects across the entire financial system.Examples:\nThe failure of a systemically important financial institution (SIFI), such as Lehman Brothers during the 2008 financial crisis.\nA collapse in interbank lending markets leading to a liquidity
