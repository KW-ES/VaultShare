> Market risk is best measured as "value at risk" using probability analysis based upon a common confidence interval (e.g., two standard deviations) and time horizon (e.g., a one-day exposure).

> reducing market risks across derivatives to a single common denominator makes aggregation, comparison, and risk control easier. "Value at risk" is the expected loss from an adverse market movement with a specified probability over a particular period of time. For example, with 97.5% probability (that is, a "confidence interval" of 97.5%), corresponding to calculations using about two standard deviations, it can be determined that any change in portfolio value over one day resulting from an adverse market movement will not exceed a specific amount. Conversely, there is a 2.5% probability of experiencing an adverse change in excess of the calculated amount. Value at risk should encompass changes in all major market risk components listed in the recommendation. The difficulty in applying the technique of value at risk increases with the complexity of the risks being managed. For comparability, value at risk should be calculated to a common confidence interval and time horizon

# Shortfalls
Unlike VaR,Â **ES considers the severity of losses beyond the chosen confidence level, resulting in a more comprehensive risk assessment**. ES emphasizes the possibility for more substantial losses during volatile periods such as the financial crisis, providing a deeper understanding of the portfolio's downside risk.
