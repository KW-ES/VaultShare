	- Something like an IRS isn't an asset so wouldn't be on the balance sheet, would have it's cashflows recorded on the income statement. A bond is something you physically hold because you know the future value but an IRS isn't an asset, so it'd be off-balance sheet.

### **On-Balance Sheet vs. Off-Balance Sheet Items**

In accounting and financial reporting, assets, liabilities, and commitments can be classified as **on-balance sheet** or **off-balance sheet** depending on whether they are recorded on a company's financial statements.

---

## **1. On-Balance Sheet Items**

These are **assets and liabilities that appear directly on the balance sheet** because the company has ownership, control, or direct financial exposure.

### **Examples of On-Balance Sheet Items:**

### **(a) Assets:**

- **Cash and Cash Equivalents** – Physical cash, bank deposits, and highly liquid short-term investments.
- **Loans and Advances** – Loans issued by banks and financial institutions.
- **Securities** – Bonds, equities, and other marketable investments owned by the entity.
- **Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE)** – Physical assets used in business operations.
- **Inventory** – Goods held for sale or production.

### **(b) Liabilities:**

- **Deposits** – Customer funds held by a bank.
- **Borrowings** – Short-term and long-term debt obligations.
- **Trade Payables** – Money owed to suppliers.
- **Bond Issuances** – Debt securities issued to investors.

### **Key Feature:**

- **Recognized in financial statements.**
- **Directly affects financial ratios, leverage, and regulatory capital requirements.**

---

## **2. Off-Balance Sheet Items**

These are financial commitments, contingent liabilities, or assets **not recorded on the balance sheet** because they do not represent a direct obligation or ownership at the time of reporting. However, they can still **create future liabilities or risks.**

### **Examples of Off-Balance Sheet Items:**

### **(a) Contingent Liabilities & Commitments:**

- **Letters of Credit (LCs)** – Guarantees issued by banks to ensure payment in international trade.
- **Loan Commitments** – Unused lines of credit that a bank has promised to lend but has not yet disbursed.
- **Guarantees and Warranties** – Promises to cover a third party’s obligation if they default.

### **(b) Financial Instruments & Derivatives:**

- **Interest Rate Swaps (IRS)** – Agreements to exchange interest rate cash flows, with no principal recorded on the balance sheet.
- **Currency Forwards & Options** – Used for FX hedging, with only changes in value reflected in financial statements.
- **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)** – Insurance-like derivatives on credit events, recorded off-balance sheet until exercised.

### **(c) Securitization & Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs):**

- **Securitized Loans (Mortgage-Backed Securities, MBS)** – Banks package and sell loans to investors, removing them from the balance sheet.
- **Leasing Arrangements (Operating Leases)** – Previously off-balance sheet (before IFRS 16), meaning companies used leased assets without recording them as liabilities.

### **Key Feature:**

- **Not recognized as direct assets or liabilities** but can create future obligations.
- **Used to manage risk, improve financial ratios, or comply with regulatory requirements.**

## **3. Importance of On vs. Off-Balance Sheet Items**

|**Aspect**|**On-Balance Sheet**|**Off-Balance Sheet**|
|---|---|---|
|**Financial Reporting**|Directly recorded in financial statements|Disclosed in footnotes or risk reports|
|**Impact on Leverage Ratios**|Affects total assets & liabilities|Can reduce reported leverage|
|**Risk Exposure**|Immediate financial impact|Potential future risk|
|**Regulatory Considerations**|Subject to capital and liquidity requirements|Often requires separate risk capital (e.g., Basel III for banks)|

---

## **Conclusion**

- **On-Balance Sheet** items include assets and liabilities that a company **owns or owes directly** and are **fully recorded** in financial statements.
- **Off-Balance Sheet** items involve **potential obligations, contingent liabilities, or transferred risks** that are **not fully recognized** but still impact financial health and risk exposure.

Financial institutions use **off-balance sheet** transactions to manage risk, optimize capital efficiency, and meet regulatory requirements while keeping certain exposures out of core financial statements.
