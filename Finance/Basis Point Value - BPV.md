### **Basis Point Value (BPV) – Definition and Explanation**

**Basis Point Value (BPV)**, also known as **Price Value of a Basis Point (PVBP)** or **DV01 (Dollar Value of 01 Basis Point)**, measures the change in the price of a bond or portfolio resulting from a **1 basis point (0.01%) change in yield**. It is a key concept in **fixed income risk management** and is used to assess interest rate risk.

### **1. Definition in Mathematical Terms**

BPV is defined as:

For a bond with price P, yield y, and modified duration Dm​, BPV can be approximated as:

### **2. Example Calculation**

Suppose we have:

- Bond price: **€1,000,000**
- Modified duration: **5 years**

This means that if interest rates **increase by 1 bp (0.01%)**, the bond price will **decrease by €500**, and if interest rates **decrease by 1 bp**, the price will **increase by €500**.

### **3. Interpretation and Applications**

- **BPV measures interest rate risk:** Higher BPV means greater sensitivity to rate changes.
- **Used for hedging:** Traders use BPV to hedge bond portfolios by adjusting positions in response to yield changes.
- **Risk management:** Helps banks and asset managers quantify portfolio exposure to small interest rate movements.

### **4. BPV vs. DV01**

- **BPV (Price Value of a Basis Point)**: Expressed in bond price units (e.g., euros, dollars).
- **DV01 (Dollar Value of 01 Basis Point)**: The same concept but specifically in dollar terms.

### **Conclusion**

BPV is a fundamental risk measure in fixed income markets that quantifies the price impact of a **1 basis point change in yield**. It is crucial for hedging and managing interest rate risk.
