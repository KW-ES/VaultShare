- YIELD CURVES:
	- The shape of a yield curve is one of many pointers as to current market sentiment in respect of the anticipated level of future interest rates. Some textbooks will suggest that longer period rates are usually higher than short rates to allow for the time and inflation risks in longer term investment. *But the shape of the money market yield curve up to 12 months at any time more significantly identifies the current market sentiment that over time interest rates are going to rise or fall*
	- 4 shapes:
	- Positive
		- ![[Pasted image 20250128191615.png]]
		- demand for money in future is higher
		- expect IR to go up
		- so borrow a lot now (while rates are lower)
	- Negative
		- ![[Pasted image 20250128191633.png]]
		- interest rates are going to fall
		- if rates are decreasing, don't want to enter(borrow) into longer term maturities when at a later point you could get a cheaper interest rate. so you'd rather get short term maturities. more demand for short term money
		- so lending now more than borrowing
		- and lend at higher rates
	- Flat

		- unknown or happy or interim
	- Humped

		- short term rise but long term fall
		- unusual state
		- or rates quoted higher than usual and may stabilise
