The terms **tenor, period, and term** are often used interchangeably in financial markets, but they have distinct meanings depending on the context. Let’s clarify the differences:

---

### **1. Tenor**

- **Definition**: The length of time until a financial instrument, contract, or agreement matures.
    
- **Common Usage**:
    
    - Refers to the duration of a financial contract (e.g., loans, bonds, swaps, FRAs).
        
    - In **FRAs**, a "6X9 FRA" has a **tenor of 3 months** (because it covers the period from 6 months to 9 months).
        
- **Example**:
    
    - A **5-year bond** has a **tenor of 5 years**.
        
    - A **3-month interbank deposit** has a **tenor of 3 months**.

### **2. Period**

- **Definition**: A specific time interval within a financial contract or calculation.
    
- **Common Usage**:
    
    - Used in interest rate calculations, payments, or reset intervals.
        
    - Can refer to interest **compounding periods** or coupon **payment periods**.
        
- **Example**:
    
    - A **floating rate loan with semi-annual interest payments** has **a 6-month interest period**.
        
    - A **quarterly coupon bond** has **a 3-month period per coupon payment**.

### **3. Term**

- **Definition**: The total lifespan or duration of a financial instrument from its start to maturity.
    
- **Common Usage**:
    
    - Used to describe the entire duration of financial contracts like loans, bonds, and leases.
        
    - Sometimes used synonymously with **tenor**, but “term” typically refers to the **full duration from issuance** rather than the remaining time.
        
- **Example**:
    
    - A **30-year mortgage** has a **term of 30 years**.
        
    - A **1-year fixed deposit** has a **term of 1 year**.
