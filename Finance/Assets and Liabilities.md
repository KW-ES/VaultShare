# Overlent and Overborrowed

![[Pasted image 20250401133247.png]]

## Overlent
- More interest rate sensitive assets than liabilities
- issued more loans than holding deposits
- exposed to falling interest rates (decrease in interest payments from your assets (loans))

> would want to hedge against **falling interest rates**:
> - sell IRS (receive fixed rate)
> - sell FRA (receive fixed rate)
> - buy future (lock in future fixed price)
> - Buy IR floor


**Impact of Interest Rate Changes:**
- **If interest rates increase â†’ Profits increase** (as loan income rises more than funding costs).
- **If interest rates decrease â†’ Profits decrease** (as loan income drops more than funding costs).

ðŸ”¹ **Example of an Overlent Position:**
- **Assets (loans):** Mostly floating-rate loans.
- **Liabilities (deposits):** Mostly fixed-rate deposits.
- **Risk:** If rates **fall**, interest income decreases while funding costs remain fixed, reducing profits.


## Overborrowed
- more interest rate-sensitive liabilities than assets.
- more deposits than loans (more liabilities than assets)

- exposed to rise in interest rates (paying back on your deposits)

> protect against **rising interest rates**
> (Do this by converting floating rate liabilities into fixed-rate liabilities)
> - buy IRS (pay fixed)
> - buy FRA (pay fixed)
> - sell future (lock in fixed price)
> - buy IR cap
