- categorised as fundamental analysis
- For simplicity's sake this may be approximated by subtraction. In normal market conditions falling interest rates reflect an expansive monetary policy. Falling “real” interest rates reflect falling inflation
- A country’s Balance of payments comprises its current account and capital account. The current account shows the net amount a country is earning if it is in surplus, or spending if it is in deficit. It is the sum of the balance of trade (net earnings on exports less payments for imports), factor income (earnings on foreign investments less payments made to foreign investors) and cash transfers.

- GNP is NOT a measure of inflation
- Technical Analysis AKA Charting
- The Efficient Market Hypothesis, or EMH, is an investment theory developed in the 1970s which states that prices reflect all available information
	-  If markets are efficient, then all information has already been discounted in the price, and so there is no way to "beat" the market because there are no undervalued or overvalued currencies/securities available
	- can't beat market and will be arbitraged away
- In the majority of OTC markets (interbank wholesale markets) it is the custom for the calling counterparty (market user) to ask the market maker for his two way price (to Buy/Sell in foreign exchange markets and the Borrow/lend in interest rate markets – though some interest rate/discount rate based short term securities can also be ‘bought’ and ‘sold’ in these markets). The logic is the same regardless of market concerned. The market maker dictates the two way price and gets the “benefit of the spread”

	- Private Clients
	- Asset Managers, sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds
	- Pension Funds, Insurance Companies
- Inflation
	- measured with CPI (Consumer Price Index)
	- "real interest rates" vs nominal
		- nominal haven't been adjusted for inflation
		- "real interest rates" _have_ i.e. been deflated
		- difference between them is the current rate of inflation
		- Falling interest rates -> expansive monetary policy
		- Falling "real" interest rates -> falling inflation
- Country's Current Account / Balance of Payments
	- BoP: comprises current account and capital account.
		- Current account:
			- shows net amount country is earing (if in surplus)
			- or spending (if in deficit)
			- Sum of the balance:
				- of trade: (net earnings on exports - payments for imports)
				- factor income (earnings on foreign investments - payments made to foreign investors)
				- cash transfers
		- Capital account:
			- records net change in ownership of foreign assets and includes:
				- reserves account:
					- international operations of a nation's central bank
				- loans and investments between that country and rest of the world
					- (but not the future regular repayments / dividends that the loans and investments yield as those are in the current account)
		- Record all cross border currency flows including movements of capital
		- can be used to value the county's currency value and exchange rate
- Money definition:
	- M1 & M2:
		- M1: currency in circulation and demand deposits (current accounts)
		- M2: savings deposits, money market securities, mutual funds, and other time deposits.
		- Different countries may have different definitions
- GDP
	- Gross Domestic Product:
		- Country's total output of goods and services
		- As a country's total income derived from output
		- or as a country's expenditure on total output including imports
- GNP
	- Gross National Product:
		- C + I + G + (X - M)
			- C = Personal Consumption Expenditures
			- I = Private Investments
			- G = Government Expenditures
			- (X - M) = Exports - Imports
		- Based on "value added"
			- Difference between price of product and costs of what it took to make it (material parts)
			- Includes labour costs, profits and overheads
	- In UK:
		- GNP = GDP + Net Property Income from Abroad
			- Means includes British residents income that are abroad being their dividends on foreign shareholdings and other returns on British investments abroad minus the return on foreign investment in the UK

# Chapter 3 Spot Foreign Exchange and Commodities
- outright today or outright tomorrow = ante spot 
	- this is because spot is T+2
	- T = Today
	- T + 1 = tomorrow
	- T + 2 = Normal Spot 
- short date: Foreign exchange deals dealt for a value date anything for value up to one month from Spot are termed “short date” transactions
- If no euro or dollar -> cross-currency
- Indirect quote = reciprocal
- base currency before the `/`
- xxxx/yyyy
- is the x quoted in y. so how many y it takes to buy 1 x
- spot rate composition:
	- points = "pips"

	- 5 point spread
	- 1 point = 1/10,000th of a currency unit
	- JPY = 1/100th
	- USD/CHF = BUY USD AGAINST CHF
	- `BUY X AGAINST Y = X/Y`
	- `SELL Y AGAINST X = X/Y`

		- Direct quote
			- buying base currency
				- want lowest offer
			- sells base currency
				- want highest bid
		- Indirect quote
			- buying quoted currency
				- want highest bid
					- (want to get as many as possible for $1) the USD Bid, is the SGD offer.
					- they're buying your dollars and converting it into the quoted currency so you want to get as much quoted currency as possible
					- ![[IMG-20260107130447485.png]]
			- Selling quoted currency
				- want lowest offer
					- converting the quoted currency back into base currency, you want to pay as little as possible to get it back into dollars. like having the denominator being as small as possible.
					- the offer is them buying it from you
					- so you want to sell it as at low as a price as possible
- AROUND THE FIGURE
	- ![[IMG-20260107130449226.png]]
- 3 conditions:
	- The ACI Dealing Certificate requires you to be able to calculate cross-rates from pairs of exchange rates where the common currency is the base currency in both rates **(referred to here as** **Condition 1),** where the common currency is the base currency in neither rate **(Condition 2)** and where the common currency is the base currency in only one rate **(Condition 3)**.
- ![[IMG-20260107130450790.png]]
- we want buying CHF and selling JPY, so we get the selling JPY side and the buying CHF side and divide them to get the **bid** side for CHF/JPY which is BUY/SELL
- ![[IMG-20260107130452087.png]]
- when both in numerator / denominator, divide
- when one in numerator / demonimator, multiply to cancel out

When a bank deals through an Interdealer broker / voice broker, the calling bank can deal with the broker "at the price", (as **a market user**) in other words **hitting the bid (selling)** the Base currency or **taking the offer (buying)** the Base currency in the market.

[[IMG-20260107130453166.pdf#page=90&selection=9,0,16,11|Interbank Dealing Methods through IDB / voice brokers]]
- Bid = yours
- Offer = mine
- ![[IMG-20260107130456855.png]]
	- Offer 2 at 27
		- decreases the offer price
		- want to find a buyer
	- Pay 52 for 5
		- increases the bid price
		- want to find a seller
	- market makes buy at the bid and sell at the offer/ask. the ask price is how much they're asking for it. you buy at *their* asking price and they *bid* for your selling price
	- so if you pay 52 for 5 and increase the bid, it means people will be able to sell at a higher price so they can more easily find a seller.
	- if you offer 2 at 27, you're decreasing the offer price, meaning it's cheaper to buy so it's more likely to find a buyer.

		- calculate the value at exchange rate and balance the books and realise the profit
		- you're currently short 1m EUR at that exchange rate with those dollars
		- and if you multiplied your euro position with the new exchange rate, you'd have that many dollars, and that would be your net position.
		- profit only realised once position is SQUARED

Settlement risk The risk that arises when payments are not exchanged simultaneously, generally arising due to time differences. One party to a transaction must effect payment or delivery in an earlier time zone without having confirmation of the receipt of a reciprocal asset in a later time zone.

# Chapter 4 Forward Foreign Exchange


- short dates up to m of one month
-  Fixed date (standard period) transactions have a maturity (value date) of one month and beyond. A typical set of standard period forward Foreign exchange rates in any of the major currency pairs would be: 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months
- 3 main contracts:
	- ![[IMG-20260107130516749.png]]
- In the interbank forward market, forward rates are quoted as a two-way price in "forward swap points".
- Forward exchange rates are quoted as swap points - price differentials by which to adjust the all-important benchmark spot exchange rate to achieve the Outright forward rate.
- Discount vs Premium
	- premium = pm
		- currency is more expensive
	- discount = disc
		- currency is cheaper to buy on the forward rate than it is to buy for spot value
		- you're comparing with the spot rate to see if it's at a premium or discount
- ![[IMG-20260107130518345.png]]
- you determine discount or prem by inspection
- low - high => Premium so add
	- forward is worth more than spot
- high - low => Discount so subtract
	- spot is worth more than forward

	Divide 75.33 by 0.8950 = 84.16(76) because it's sell JPY and buy CHF and it's JPY per Swiss francs. that gives you the BUY CHF/SELL JPY  which will be the SELL/BUY therefore the bid.
	Divide 75.43 by 0.8940 = 84.37(36) because that's Buy JPY and sell CHF, so SELL CHF/ BUY JPY, which is the offer
	think of X **per** Y. so it's X **divided by** Y. it's JPY/CHF but we want CHF/JPY so it's the BID (OFFER) but we want offer(BID) so we swap it and it becomes bid(OFFER)

		- calculate outright forward price:
			- take spot rate and add/subtract forward points if discount or premium
				- 1/10,000 if normal
				- 1/100 if 2 decimal currency (JPY)
				- add if premium
				- subtract if discount
				- do for both bid and offer
		- once done then do cross currency applications
- Forward Cross Currency points
	- asked to calculate forward points from cross currency

A swap deal comprises two deals (spot against forward)
The percentage is reduced still further when the forward deals are considered. A swap deal comprises two deals (spot against forward) and again the initial interbank transaction will give rise the further swap deals being effected. The result of all this activity brings the percentage of customer deals overall to approximately 5 to 7 % of all transactions in the market. **This is the way the foreign exchange market generates its own liquidity.** These sequences of transaction ensure that the next time this or another customer calls a bank the dealer will be able to find a price in the market and quote the customer accordingly.
iii) The more sophisticated corporate customers also tend to deal on this basis preferring to choose their moment of entry into the spot market [2] and then extending the position forward to the required date using a foreign exchange swap [3].

> [!note] page 142, taking less notes now for speed

As noted earlier in this chapter, the forward swap points, the standard method of quotation in the forward foreign exchange market, are equivalent to the interest rate differential between the two currencies involved. 
![[IMG-20260107130536593.png]]
y = y1 + (y2-y1)`x`(X-x1)/(x2-x1)
x2>x1
y2>y1
once you get those points, THEN you add them to get the outright price or quote
**swap points = forward outright rate - spot rate**


- A Time or Delivery option forward exchange contract is defined as a forward contract where the delivery date of the foreign currency is at the customer's option
- Should the full amount not be able to be settled by the final date of the option period, then a spot exchange deal reversing the initial operation must be effected to "CLOSE-OUT" the balance of the option contract
n-d-f = non-deliverable forward
A foreign exchange swap is defined as ‘a simultaneously dealt set of two linked exchange transactions involving the purchase and the sale of an identical amount of one currency against a countercurrency with differing maturities, most frequently spot value against a forward value date’.

[[IMG-20260107130453166.pdf#page=146&selection=22,0,22,21|Forward Exchange Swaps]]

- Market makers bid:
	- ![[IMG-20260107130538403.png]]
	- adding the (0.0054) that's how you get the 54. because you just quote the fwd points.
	- look at me/us my favour/yours etc.
- Fixing spot rates to the counterparties of swap transactions:
	- ![[IMG-20260107130540226.png]]
- Can square market positions in 2 ways:
	- These positions can be squared in two different ways – either using Money market or Foreign exchange swap techniques
- spot = t+2

> Forward/forward foreign exchange swap Example

As already mentioned, as with any forward exchange transaction the now withdrawn ACI Model Code **requires that all forward rates should reflect the current spot exchange rate.** It is therefore important that in the case of forward/forward swap transactions both legs are based on the current spot rate, i.e. in this 3s v. 6s example the three months forward rate should be the spot rate at the time of dealing adjusted by the three months swap points and the six months exchange rate should be the spot rate at the time of dealing adjusted by the six months swap points.
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">You can determine the spot rate or forward rate or forward swap points from each other (they ask this)</mark>

- Actual / 360 day count basis. This basis is frequently referred to as the **Money market basis**
- govmt bonds may use Act / act
- For all the above bases the term Actual* (above the line) refers to the actual number of days in any period for which interest is being calculated
- ![[IMG-20260107130602083.png]]
- For all the above bases the term Actual* (above the line) refers to the actual number of days in any period for which interest is being calculated. i.e. an overnight deal is 1 day whereas a one month transaction may vary from 27 to around 35 actual elapsed days depending on the calendar dates / holidays involved. (See page 198 et seq). This is **sometimes referred to as the tenor**, particularly when Bill of Exchange transactions are being described.

- rates
	- UK = SONIA
		- On each London business day, SONIA is measured as the trimmed mean, rounded to four decimal places, of interest rates paid on eligible Sterling denominated deposit transactions. 
	- EUR = ESTR
	- US = EFFR and SOFR
- Under the BBA, LIBOR was referred to as the rate at which “prime banks” lent to one another. In 1995 the official definition was amended to “the rate of interest at which deposits are perceived to be generally available in the London interbank market”
- ICE LIBOR used for FRA's and IRS's
- LIBOR = London Interbank Offer Rate
- Benchmark Determination Methodology = BDM
- BMR compliant = benchmark regulations compliant
- OI = overnight indicies
	- basis of OIS's
- **RONIA** is the Sterling Repurchase (Repo) Overnight Index Average Rate and is an index which tracks actual market secured overnight funding rates in Sterling.
- **EONIA** (Euro OverNight Index Average) used to be the rate used for EUR OIS and was calculated daily by the European Central Bank (ECB) as a weighted average of all overnight unsecured lending transactions in the interbank market up to the end of 2021. **EONIA has now been replaced by €STR / ESTR**
- **Euro Short-Term Rate (€STR, ESTR or ESTER)** is a rate which reflects the wholesale euro unsecured overnight borrowing costs
	- replaced EONIA and may replace EURIBOR
	- ESTR is calculated on the borrowing cost of the wholesale markets (banks and corporates) rather than the lending costs solely in the interbank market.
- **Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR)**
	- calculated by NYFED
	- EFFR is calculated as a volume-weighted median of overnight federal funds transactions reported in the FR 2420 Report of Selected Money Market Rates
- The alternative rate in the **US** is the **Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)** that is now **replacing LIBOR**.
	- SOFR is based on transactions in the US Treasury repo market cleared through the Delivery-versus-Payment (DVP) services offered by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) and is based on data from observable transactions rather than on estimated borrowing rates
- Alternative SOFR: [[IMG-20260107130453166.pdf#page=215&selection=0,3,9,56|ACI Textbook1, page 215]]
	- US-based Alternative Reference Rates Committee = (ARRC)
	- Term SOFR is an attractive replacement for USD LIBOR because, like LIBOR, Term SOFR allows borrowers and lenders to know the benchmark interest rate on a loan at the beginning (as opposed to near the end) of each interest period by simply looking at the relevant Bloomberg/Reuters page
- **SARON is the Swiss Average Rate OverNight**. It is an overnight interest rates average referencing the Swiss Franc interbank repo market. replaced TOIS

- roll-over loans
	- rate is reset with floating rate
	- reset dates are when floating rate is observed (they release the rate to the public)
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES</mark>
	- Over recent years many markets have experienced negative interest rates – where the borrowing institution repays less than the amount invested at maturity.
	- ![[IMG-20260107130620965.png]]
- YIELD CURVES:
	- The shape of a yield curve is one of many pointers as to current market sentiment in respect of the anticipated level of future interest rates. Some textbooks will suggest that longer period rates are usually higher than short rates to allow for the time and inflation risks in longer term investment. *But the shape of the money market yield curve up to 12 months at any time more significantly identifies the current market sentiment that over time interest rates are going to rise or fall*
	- 4 shapes:
	- Positive
		- ![[IMG-20260107130623217.png]]
		- demand for money in future is higher
		- expect IR to go up
		- so borrow a lot now (while rates are lower)
	- Negative
		- ![[IMG-20260107130625445.png]]
		- interest rates are going to fall
		- if rates are decreasing, don't want to enter(borrow) into longer term maturities when at a later point you could get a cheaper interest rate. so you'd rather get short term maturities. more demand for short term money
		- so lending now more than borrowing
		- and lend at higher rates
	- Flat
		- ![[IMG-20260107130627856.png]]
		- unknown or happy or interim
	- Humped
		- ![[IMG-20260107130629892.png]]

- To obtain finance against a Bill of Exchange, the instrument (the Bill of Exchange) has to be discounted

- NOTE HINT: **THESE FORMULAS CAN ALSO BE USED FOR TREASURY BILLS AS WELL AS BILLS OF EXCHANGE**
	- ![[IMG-20260107130651565.png]]
- . To be able to be compared to a simple interest rate (yield) a discount rate must be converted onto the same basis as the yield rate. This is done using the discount to yield formula. **A discount rate will always appear numerically to be lower than its equivalent yield rate.** This is because the return (the interest or discount amount earned) is the result of applying the discount rate to the face or maturity value – a larger amount than the price paid for the instrument. To achieve the same return on the amount invested (the price) a numerically higher rate of return must be achieved.

- US CD's
	- Also CDs in the US markets tend to be a **retail** investment instrument whereas in the European markets they are only bought and sold by **wholesale market participants**
	- short term market
- Discount CD's
	- Discount CDs are occasionally encountered. These are based on the Discount- paying instruments quoted as a rate of discount formula for pricing (similar to US T-Bills). The Bank of England Market guidelines publication allows for these instruments and states that ‘Discounted CDs are bought and sold on a discount per annum basis or on a yield to maturity basis’. **Discount CDs do NOT feature in the ACI Dealing Certificate syllabus.**

- Commercial paper
	- issue of **short term promissory notes** by commercial companies through dealer banks acting as brokers seeking investors willing to purchase the issue. Commercial paper is issued on demand according to the issuing company’s funding requirements and is usually for **very short term periods - typically 14 days and one month**
	- UK
		- discount to yield
			- The yield rate is applied to the price paid to achieve the discount amount
	- **Discount-paying instruments quoted as a true yield (price or secondary market proceeds)**
		- ![[IMG-20260107130720989.png]]
		- face value = 5,000,000
		- days = 30
		- GBP therefore 365
		- Commercial paper therefore yield
		- libor plus 25 bp
			- 5% so 0.05 and 25bp = 25/10,000 = 0.0025 = 0.0525
		- want price so need proceeds
	- There is no active secondary market in commercial paper, but dealing firms including banks will normally undertake to repurchase the paper at prevailing rates, thus providing limited liquidity to investors.
	- Credit ratings apply
		- in US
		- In short term
			- ![[IMG-20260107130723683.png]]
	- US Commercial Paper
		- Discount-paying instrument quoted as a rate of discount. i.e. the discount rate is applied to the face value. **The same formula as used for Treasury Bills and Bankers Acceptances is used in US Domestic CP pricing**
		- ![[IMG-20260107130726247.png]]
		- US CP market > T-bills market
		- Secondary market small
		- In the US CP can be issued for periods ranging from 1 day to 270 days with the most active issues being in issues of under 30 days. The 270 day maximum maturity is to avoid the necessity of registering the issue with the SEC (any instrument with a maturity in excess of 270 days is deemed to be a bond and must be so registered). For this reason a lot of US based corporate issuers use a technique of ‘rolling’ (renewing) a series of 270 day issues.

	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">NB!!!</mark> QUOTED AS DISCOUNT VS QUOTED AS YIELD
		- ![[IMG-20260107130730161.png]]
	- Note: Remember, when a financial instrument is **quoted/priced as a “Discount- paying instrument quoted as a rate of discount**” the result (price or secondary market proceeds) can always be **arrived at / checked by first converting the discount rate to a yield** (page 73.) and then using the “**Discount- paying instrument quoted as a yield” formula**
- Pricing along the yield curve (into the future) (Forward/Forward)
	- You must therefore be able to calculate an interest rate for such a period priced ‘along the yield curve’ and described as “forward/forward”
	- this is the alternative to pricing from spot
	- ![[IMG-20260107130731994.png]]
	- 3v6 forward forward means from 3 month to 6month period out of the period
	- Forward/forward interest rates can also be referred to as **“implied” forward rates or break-even rate**s (when describing mismatched interest rate risk positions).
	- ![[IMG-20260107130733883.png]]

	- take longs over shorts and get forward rate
	- annual basis is 360
	- broken dated interest rates not featured in ACI
- Important for hedging
	- Before a dealer can even decide whether or not to hedge he must be aware of any current forward/forward mismatch positions and their “break-even” rates. These are calculated using the forward/forward formula
- **n vs m**
	- Forward/forward positions are described using the number of months from spot to the start of the forward/forward period to the number of months from spot to the end of the period. For example in January a forward/forward position from March to June would be described as 2s v. 5s (said “twos / fives”). Similar terminology is used to describe forward/forward periods for FRAs (See Chapter 7)
- Islamic Banking
	- Sukuk Certificates **like bond** but Sharia compliant
		- main difference is that sukuks are asset owner ship vs bonds are debt obligations
			- both provide investors with payment streams (like coupons for western bonds)
		- asset ownership for debt markets
		- interest = "riba"
		- used by individuals and corporations
		- purchase asset and distribute profit
			- Require the issuer to use the funds that were raised to buy a specific asset and then distribute the profit generated by that underlying asset on a periodic basis (like a coupon payment) to the sukuk holders.

	- Mudharabah **profit sharing**
		- Aka (**Qirad**) / Mudaraba
		- Most frequently traded/encountered one based on profit sharing
		- Mud = profit sharing
		- profit sharing
		- Parties
			- party covering funds
				- (financier)
				- Rab al maal
				- supplies the funds for the endeavour
			- agent
				- Mudarib / Ameel
				- Acts as agent or entrepreneur undertaking the business
		- Short term and optional (Max 1 year)
			- Gives both parties the right to revoke the agreement unless put in a condition that you can't
		- Based on These principles![[IMG-20260107130745195.png]]
		- The Mudarib (Agent) can only lose time and effort
		- Financier (Rab al maal) takes on the potential financial loss
			- But they can't intervene in the running of the underlying business or transaction.
		- 3 Components
			- Safe-depositary
			- Trustee agent
			- Partnership
	- Murabaha **credit**
		- Mur = murex = credit
		- Form of credit
			- Cost of underlying goods as well as profit is known to both parties
		- Purchase and selling price (including profit) must be clearly stated at time of contract.
		- Payment may be:
			- Up front
			- Installments
			- Lump sum later
		- Used widely by Islamic banks as it is a means of interest-free financing. Used to Finance the purchase of consumer goods, real estate, raw materials, machinery and equipment
		- Can be used as leverage for short-term trading needs and pre-shipment export finance.
		- Islamic banks take the commercial risk between the purchase of the asset from the seller and the sale of the asset to the ultimate client requiring the goods. The bank is compensated for the time value of its money in the form of the profit margin but cannot charge any additional sum for late payments. The purchased asset remains with the bank until the Murabahah is paid in full.
		- Subject to rules of Bai' al Sarf (to exchange a price for a price in the same currency) and cannot be sold through Murabaha.

	- Before a bond issue is made, it is traded in the ‘grey market’. This is a market where traders sell the issue short hoping to buy them in the cash market after issue at a lower price. Lead managers can see from the grey market what the professional traders in the secondary market think the issue is worth and can therefore pitch the price accordingly. The final price of an issue is often delayed until this information comes through from the grey market.
- ICMA = International Capital Markets Association merged ISMA
- IPMA = International Primary Markets Association
	- facilitator
- Gilts = UK bonds
	- most fixed but can be floating
	- up to 30 years
	- coupon = "dividend"
	- Actual/actual
	- coupon = semi annual
	- non-redeemable gilts = "perpetuals"
- US Treasury *Notes*
	- 2-10 years
	- fixed
	- actual/actual
	- pay interest (coupon)
- US Treasury Bonds
	- 30yr -> "long bond"
	- paying simple interest (a coupon) semi annually on an Actual / Actual
- T-Notes + T-Bonds = "Treasuries"
- Euro zone gov bonds
	- Governments of those EU countries currently participating in the Euro all issue bonds denominated in EUR paying simple interest (a coupon) annually on an Actual / Actual annual basis
- ![[IMG-20260107130747570.png]]
- Corporate bonds
	- Domestic
	- or Eurobonds i.e. issued in currency which is a doreign currency in chosen financial market centre
	- **Eurobond interest is calculated on a 30 / 360 (360 / 360) day count basis**
- rating agencies
	- S&P
	- Moody's
	- Fitch
	- Duff&Phelps
	- ![[IMG-20260107130749907.png]]
- BBB- and Baa3 are BANK QUALITY
- lower is Junk (High yield and speculative)
- ![[IMG-20260107130752067.png]]
- EURObonds = Bearer
	- no ownership -> anonymity
	- physically held
	- tear off coupons
	- When an interest payment is 260 due the owner of the bond must present the appropriate tear off coupon to the issuer’s paying agent who then makes the payment as directed at that time. At maturity bearer bonds are redeemed by returning the original certificate to the paying agent. Ownership is therefore easy to prove and in the UK and Europe registered securities are supported by physical debt certificates
- UK/US gov = registered securities
	- registered -> have owner's details
	- changes in ownership recorded
	- "book entry"
	- no hard copy
- nominal value:
	- Every bond has a **fixed value or redemption value** – often referred to as **nominal value**. This is the amount the **issuer will repay** at maturity if the terms of the issue state that the bond will be redeemed **‘at par’**. However, the redemption value of some types of bond can be higher than their nominal value – depending on the specific terms of the issue
- US usually issued at $1000
- UK is 100
- bond is priced as percentage of par
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">IR up, bond price down and vice versa</mark>
- **If the price of a bond is above PAR**:
	- this means that it is trading at a **premium over face value** and **current interest rates must be lower than the coupon rate** offered on the bond.
	- **If the price of a bond is below PAR:**
	- this means that it is trading at a **discount against face value** and **current interest rates must be higher than the coupon rate** offered on the bond.
- Clean vs Dirty
	- Bond prices are generally quoted ‘clean’, i.e. without accrued interest. If the accrued interest is included in the price, the price is known as the ‘dirty’ price
-  Short term US government debt – US Treasury Bills are money market instruments. are issued by the US Treasury for 91 days, 182 days and 52 weeks
- 2 types:
	- notes - 2 to 10 years
	- bonds - 30 years
- Hybrid Bonds
	- callable bonds (issuer can exercise)
	- putable bonds (investor can exercise)
	- ![[IMG-20260107130755230.png]]
- Floating rate notes = FRNs
	- usually coupons are fixed interest
	- FRN not fixed
	- FRN rate periodically reset
	- can be expressed as margin over benchmark IR
	- types:
		- Perpetual FRN
			- no maturity
		- Capped FRN
			- A capped FRN sets an upper limit on the borrower’s interest rate and a an FRN can include a floor which sets a minimum rate of interest payable. 
		- 'mini max'
			- predefined range
		- 'flip-flops'
			- float freely
		- 'drop-lock'
			- rate can float down to a pre-set minimum and then be locked at that rate for the remainder of the life of the bond, i.e. the FRN converts to a fixed rate bond
	- FRN's are to the claims of depositors
		- count towards bk's capital base
- In case of liquidation, seniority will take place, get paid out first. (Subordinated)
- Foreign bond names
	- US: Yankees
	- UK: Bulldogs
	- Japan: Samurai
	- Greece: Marathons
	- Spain: Matadors
	- Canada: Maples
- Bond variations:
	- zero-coupon
		- no dividends or coupons
		- The bond is issued at a (deep) discount on issue and subsequent trading prices of the bond will reflect current yield to maturity levels only
		- since no coupon, all gain is initial investment and payoff
		- Changes to UK taxation will remove benefits of owning zero coupon bonds, since coupons and **capital gains will both be subject to Income Tax**
	- Convertibles
		- bond which with an option can be converted into equity or another bond/commodity
		- can be zero coupon
		- conversion can be mandatory
		- coupon < normal
		- conversion rate set to be equivalent >  ‘equivalent’ [[IMG-20260107130453166.pdf#page=263&selection=91,0,93,0|ACI Textbook1, page 263]]
		- The Conversion ratio is the bond denomination divided by the conversion price
- Repos and Reverse repos:
	- Stands for sale and repurchase agreements
	- **definition:**
		- A Repo is the sale and commitment to repurchase securities at a fixed price or at the same price but with a Repo rate of interest applied and paid on the cash consideration (set at time of dealing) at a later date
	- reverse repo is the other side, look at borrower of securities or lender of funds viewpoint (collateralised loan)
	- Some terms:
		- **General Collateral (GC)**
			- most normal
			- generally secured against Gilts (or other securities)
		- **Delivery By Value (DBV)**
			- Special types of GC
			- uses CrestCo (formerly CGO)
			- only specify *value* of collateral
		- **Specials**
			- borrow/lend against *special* Gilt issue against cash
			- repo rates < GC bc dealers want to be competitive
			- Specials are often brought about by a demand for the CTD (cheapest to deliver) bonds underlying ICE Gilt Futures
	- Repo diagram:
		- normal repo:
			- selling and buying securities
		- reverse repo
			- buying and selling securities
		- ![[IMG-20260107130757228.png]]
		- A sells securities for cash (Repo) (sells)
		- B Pays cash for securities (Reverse Repo) (buys)
		- cash is appreciated at repo rate or forward price
		- ![[IMG-20260107130759167.png]]
		- NOTE BID vs OFFER quote order
		- London: Reverse repo - repo
		- International: Repo - Reverse Repo
	- **UK REPO RATES**
		- A Repo rate is a simple interest rate which is applied to the initial consideration paid on the start date of the Repo to the repoing party (cash in) and paid on the maturity date of the repo (or as otherwise agreed)
	- Gilt repo
		- -> classic repo or sell/buy backs
		- settled under CrestCo (formerly CGO) part of Euroclear group
		- Gilts exchanged in Repo transactions as 'classic repo'
	- **US**
		- banks use repos to change money supply to commercial banks, influencing level of IR
		- main by Fed
	- **CLASSIC REPOS**
		- **In contrast** to secured deposits, **legal title to collateral in a Classic Repo is transferred to the buyer**
			- Allows buyer to sell on securities he has bought through reverse repo
		- transfer of legal title also gives buyer (reverse repoer) of collateral the *rights of close-out and set-off* if repo defaults
			- i.e. convert to cash
		- where as in a secured deposit, the disposal of collateral must wait upon the implementation of bankruptcy proceedings
	- REPO DATES: [[Modified Following]]
	- > For fixed periods shorter than 1 month [[IMG-20260107130453166.pdf#page=266&selection=134,0,134,38|ACI Textbook1, page 266]]
	- **Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA)**
		- bilateral
		- **TBMA / ICMA**
		- The Bond Market Association -> prev. PSA -> Public Securities Association
		- IMA = International Capital Market Association -> ISMA (International Securities Market Association)
	- Legal title of collateral is trans. in repo and risk and return remains with seller.  Thus a default on the collateral (however unthinkable in respect of government debt) would require the seller to supply new collateral
	- Because of the fixed price of the repurchase (i.e. in cash driven transactions the same as the initial consideration plus repo interest), any fall in the price of the collateral is automatically a loss to the seller and any rise in the price of the collateral is automatically a gain
	- bond's <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">clean price </mark>is what is usually quoted (remember without interest)
		- quoted per 100 (par)
			- For example, in the case of Gilts this could be 98.50 meaning GBP 98.50 per GBP 100 face value
		- sum of present value of all future cashflows (cashflow discount model)
		- Pricing above/below par:
			- As bonds are **typically fixed income securities** they may be priced below, at or above par value.
			- Bond prices **below the par value**:
				- indicate that current **interest rates are higher than the bond coupon**
				- meaning an investor to achieve current interest rates overall **must buy at a discount**
			- Bond prices **above the par value**
				- indicate that current **interest rates must be lower than the bond coupon**
				- meaning an investor, to achieve current interest rates overall is **prepared to pay a premium.** 
			- The relationship of current interest rates v. fixed income bonds means that **when interest rates are rising the price of a bond falls and where interest rates are falling the price of a bond rises**
	- Dirty Price
		- aka "all-in" price or "gross" price
		- which takes clean price and adds accrued interest
		- The dirty price is the price at which the securities can be sold in the secondary market (cash bonds). If repo collateral is not valued at its dirty price, the buyer of the collateral would pay less for the securities through the repo than he could make by selling them into the secondary market. Not only would the seller have lost the use of this amount, but it would also represent an interest free loan and an unsecured credit exposure to the buyer
	- UK GOV bonds -> ACT/ACT
		- ![[IMG-20260107130801023.png]]
	- Repo cash driven trade
		- dirty price is important and is used as initial consideration
		- repo rate of int is used for this consideration by cash borrower
		- flat basis = no margin
		- ![[IMG-20260107130802959.png]]
		- choose bid because it's london so it's bid-offer
		- and bid because we're buying as marker user
		- 0.035 from 7%/2
		- 10 days because it's 17th June to 7th of June
		- multiply 103 by 10,000,000
		- dirty price = clean price + accrued interest from last coupon date
		- accrued interest is the 10 days, june to december -> 6 months therefore 180 days + 3 days and it's act/act
		- so we accrued that interest.
		- dirty price = clean price plus that
		- ![[IMG-20260107130804717.png]]
	- intitial consideration and maturity consideration:
		- ![[IMG-20260107130806736.png]]
		- ![[IMG-20260107130808625.png]]
		- repurchase consideration = initial consideration + repo interest payable for 30 days at repo rate and use the day count for the country
		- initial consideration = dirty price
		- maturity consideration = initial consideration + repo interest accrued
	- haircut
		- GRMA allows for margining negotiation -> haircuts
	- margins
		- **repo initial margin**
			- agreed when GMRA is drawn up bilaterally by senior management banks (not the dealers) based on credit ratings of 2 parties to agreement
			- By GMRA, may be charged by either party to repo but *usually* case to reverse repoer (lending cash against securities) charges the initial margin to the repoer (the one who is giving the securities)
		- **margin ratio**
			- initial margin gets a **haircut**
				- GMRA margin process has a "margin ratio"
					- ratio of market price to repo consideration
					- e.g
						- margin of 2.5% means ratio of 1.025
						- so initial consideration in a margined repo the dirty price is either:
							- divided by haircut for **reverse repo**
							- multiplied by haircut for **repoer**
			- **Repo with margin** / **Margin Calculations** [[IMG-20260107130453166.pdf#page=271&selection=2,0,8,5|ACI Textbook1, page 271]]

				- Repo with margin (margin in favour of <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">REVERSE REPOER</mark>)
					- margin charged by reverse repoer
					- so it's divided

				- Initial Consideration (Margin in favour of <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">REVERSE REPOER</mark>)
					- clean price
					- calculate dirty price = clean price + 10 days accrued
					- dirty price / 1.025
					- less cash advanced than market value for collateral
					- / 1.025
					- round to get initial consideration -> 10,067,000
					- make AIP -> 100.67
				- Repurchase Consideration (Margin in favour of <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">REVERSE REPOER</mark>)
					- repurchase consideration = initial consideration + repo int payable (here 30 days)
					- simple interest is for act/365 because GBP
					- calculate repo int payable 
					- then add that to initial consideration
				- Repo with margin (margin in favour of<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;"> REPOER</mark>)
					- better credit
					- margin *charged*
					- initial consideration will be dirty price *multiplied*
					- therefore MORE cash than market value for collateral
				- Initial Consideration (Margin in favour of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">REPOER</mark>)
					- clean price + int accrued to get dirty price
					- dirty price MULTIPLED by 1.025
					- then ROUND
					- 10,577,000
					- AIP = 105.77
				- Repurchase Consideration (Margin in favour of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">REPOER</mark>)
					- repurchase consideration = initial consideration + repo int payable (here 30 days)
					- calc repo int payable with simple interest and repo rate and 30/365 bc UK
					- add to initial consideration
				- ![[IMG-20260107130810544.png]]
			- Variation margin
				- eliminates credit exposure for movements of value from underlying collateral in MtM
				- Variation margin examples [[IMG-20260107130453166.pdf#page=272&selection=162,14,162,20|ACI Textbook1, page 272]]
				- Margin threshold
					- defined by GMRA (global master repurchase agreement)
						- MtM when move my percentage agreed and trigger margin call
						- and threshold crossed by "material"  (agreed upon) value
		- Margin calls
			- triggered when collateral shortfall exceeds the variation margin
			-  The party being called for variation margin has the right to choose whether margin shall be delivered in securities or cash
			- variation margin triggered by collateral price movement can be absolute or proportional movement but it's an agreed upon value
			- **alternative approaches to VM calls**
				- is to "closing out" original transaction and re-open with new terms to reflect movement in value of collateral.
				- requires a repurchase date (maturity) -> of original transaction is now the date which the repricing is to be effected and you enter a *new* repo transaction which is a repriced transaction:
				- **terms**
					- i)
						- securities collateral remains same
					- ii)
						- opening date reset = repricing date.
						- initial consideration now recalculated -> multiplied by margin ratio = market value of secs on repricing date
					- iii)
						- close out amount of OG transaction is compared to repriced. get net payment from one party to other and has to be made within time frame agreed in GMRA (global master repurchase agreement)
					- iv)
						- repurchase date (maturity) of OG trans., repo rate and marg ratio remain same as OG trans.
					- whole thing means repo is adjusted to match repriced collateral for remaining period or until such date when change in value is to be deemed "material" (included in GMRA (global material repurchase agreement))
	- coupon payments and interest
		- on *collateral* returned to seller (repoer)
		- done through CrestCo for Gilts part of Euroclear
		- but otherwise interest paid during term of repo in buy/sell is paid to *new owner of security* and is then either factored into the maturity repurchase price or passed back to the seller as pre-agreed between the parties
- **Sell/Buy Back**
	- repo without benefit of GMRA (Global Master repurchase agreement)
		- 2 separate transactions
		- not priced as int cost on cash (dirty price) against collateral on, the forward settlement is made on a re-priced bond basis using formula on formula sheet
	- **Sell/Buy Backs vs. Classic Repos**
		- Sbbs are undocumented and don't permit VM
		- but latest GMRA provides legal framework for SBbs
		- Cash driven trades can be rounded but no rounding in SBbs
			- SBbs are treated as 2 separats trans without including use of IM or VM
		- Typically SBbs the return on a repo is not paid as int, its incorporated in repo price at on the forward date.
			- like secs prices, the SBs price = clean price (excluded accrued int at termination (the forward date))
		- any dividend or coupon is paid during term of SBb, returned to seller at maturity + reinvestment return (usually calced at OG repo rate

- Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs)
	- initially OTC
	- bc of Futures
	- Through FRABBA
	- Merged into ISDA
	- Definition
		- non-transferable ("off-balance sheet") (no exchange of principal amount takes place)
		-  agreement between two counterparties, usually banks, developed to *protect the parties against a future adverse movement in interest rates*.
		- Counterparties to an FRA agree an interest rate to be applied to a notional deposit of an agreed principal amount for a specified period of time from a specified future date, known as the settlement date
		- like forward except no exchange of funds
		- or futures without margin requirements
		- unwinding and contractual obligation:
			- non-negotiable and non-assignable
			- can be unwound if no longer required
			- lifted by doing an equal and opposite transaction with a different counterparty
			- when both transactions are left to settle on the appropriate date or with the same counterparty where it can be agreed to calculate the forward dated settlement difference and then discount the amount and pay on cancellation date **(removing any residual credit (market replacement / delivery) risk**
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The Buyer of an FRA seeks to protect himself against a rise in interest rates, the Seller seeks protection against a fall in interest rates. In an FRA you are in effect buying or selling the interest rate.</mark>
		- buy/sell logic is opposite to futures market
		- buying FRA is like borrowing money while selling is like lending the money
	- Not linked to loan or deposit
		- there is no exchange of physical principal
	- The counterparties agree that on settlement date the contractual rate for the FRA is compared against a **market rate benchmark (Settlement rate)** and the discounted difference is paid over by the one to the other counterparty. *think of the calculation*
	- periods
		- like f/f
		- first date = settlement
		- second date = maturity
		- 3v6 most liquid
		- ![[IMG-20260107130814094.png]]
		- can be any period bc OTC
	- same as MM, quoted as IR's
		- ![[IMG-20260107130815547.png]]
	- As with a spot exchange operation there is no immediate profit (unless the dealer is simultaneously dealt with on his offer and bid by two counterparties) and profit is made by constant market making
	- FRA Settlement
		- settlement date <=><mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> fixing date</mark>
		- differences between parties is settled on settlement date
		- cash settlement is discounted at agreed settlement rate
		- ![[IMG-20260107130817364.png]]
	- Where the Settlement rate on fixing date is a **higher rate** than the FRA contractual rate,
		- the buyer of the FRA (originally wishing to *protect against a rise* in interest rates) receives a discounted settlement payment from the Seller equal to the difference between the contractual rate of the FRA and the higher Settlement rate.
		- **(buyer gets from seller)**
	- Where Settlement rate on fixing date is a **lower rate** than the FRA contractual rate,
		- the seller of the FRA (originally wishing to *protect against a fall* in interest rates) receives a discounted settlement payment from the Buyer equal to the difference
		- **(seller gets from buyer)**
	- An FRA is a Contract for Difference (CFD) in Bank of England terminology.
	- [[IMG-20260107130453166.pdf#page=294&selection=141,0,141,11|ACI Textbook1, page 294]] FRA EXAMPLE
		- "mismatch risk"
	- use FRABBA terms to see if settlement rate is higher than FRA contractual rate
	- get reimbursed the **discounted** difference
	- settlement rate is also used as the discount rate
	- ![[IMG-20260107130819012.png]]
	- FRA rate (contractual rate / fixed rate) subtracted by Settlement rate (reference rate / Libor / floating rate)
		- ![[IMG-20260107130820593.png]]
	- ![[IMG-20260107130822327.png]]
	- The FRA allows you to hedge against interest rates to a settlement date (fixing date) so effectively you can buy certainty and fix and interest rate to be paid for a forward/forward period.<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> therefore it is an interest rate equivalent to an outright forward exchange contract</mark>
		- you can fix the interest rate to be higher or lower than the benchmark rate then fix it to be paid for the forward/forward period
	- **Pricing FRA's**
		- **Pricing FRA from forward/forward**
			- use it to get BID and OFFER FRA rates
			- can use forward/forward formula from CH5
			- ![[IMG-20260107130824700.png]]
			- ![[IMG-20260107130827754.png]]
			- forward rate is the difference rate between the long period and the short period
				- BID:
					- Long date bid / short date Offer
				- OFFER
					- Long date offer / short date bid
				- *think numerator matches what you want and then use opposite as short one*
		- **Pricing FRA from Futures strip**
			- futures price to forward = 100 - fwd/fwd
			- e.g. future = 93.22 -> (100 - 6.78 (from fwd/fwd))
			- forward/forward rate is gotten by compounding (multiplying) the 2 forward/forward IR's implied (derived from) the futures prices.
				- you get the 2 futures prices from first date you want, e.g. 3m and then second date e.g. 6m
				- you can compound them because they don't generate cashflows
			- futures -> Act/360
			- ![[IMG-20260107130830277.png]]
			- ![[IMG-20260107130832099.png]]
				- you divide by 4 because it's 90/360 
				- to get the fwd/fwd rate to work with you need to do as mentioned above (100 - futures = fwd/fwd)
				- if doing 3 futures:
					- ![[IMG-20260107130833733.png]]
					- you'd multiply by 4/3 because this represents 9 months (3 futures) and that's 9/12 = 3/4. but to get it annualised (for FRA rate), multiply by the reciprocal which is 4/3
		- **Cash IR from consecutive cash and fwd/fwd (FRA) IR's**
			- using a spot rate (3m)
			- and a forward rate (3/6m)
			- want cash rate
			- ![[IMG-20260107130835301.png]]
			- basically like opposite of calculating forward rate
			- ![[IMG-20260107130836966.png]]
			- once you have the rate, double check this by using fwd/fwd formula like we said which does the opposite / used in the other way (it becomes the long rate in the fwd/fwd formula)
	- Unwind an FRA by selling/buying the same times
		- cancels out
	- Uses for FRA's
		- For **banks**:
			- hedging interest rate risks in the cash book
			- hedging short term interest rate risks in the floating side of the swaps book
			- ‘assisting’ in liquidity management (offsetting some of the costs between shorter term low yielding liquid assets and the longer term liabilities taken in funding)
			- a trading substitute for “on balance sheet” position taking (taking a view on and trading interest rates)
			- arbitraging FRAs v. Futures contracts
			- providing a corporate customer service (perhaps better placed first on this list for some banks).
		- For Corporate treasurers
			- budgeting and planning 
			- extending price availability for longer term projects
	- Pro's to FRA's (summary of benefits)
		- FRA = CFD in BoE (England)
		- Used for IR protection only
		- Extremely liquid as MM's are willing to quote prices in any currency & period up to 2 - 2.5 yr horizon
		- OTC therefore tailer made
		- Flexible so good for hedging
		- Better for managing IR risk over longer period than cash markets can
		- FRA rate is determined by the market, reflecting the pricing of Fwd/fwd periods coming off of the cash market yield curve
		- FRA market is quoted and dealt akin to cash markets so no need for steep learning curve like other products
		- **No up front premium or margin to pay when entering into an FRA**
		- Can be unwound easily by entering into equal and opposite FRA so true definition of hedge
		- All FRA outstanding's of "off balance sheet"
	- Credit risk for FRA's is low and so is credit utilisation which is good for both buyer and seller (bank and corporate)
		- credit risk is asymmetric
			- if on mtm, the settlement of FRA will result in the bank getting the difference then it is deemed to be the risk utilisation under the limit granted
			- If on mtm the bank would pay the difference, then it is taken as 'zero risk'.
			- low risk in terms of capital requirements
	- hedging vs trading
		- hedging
			- can be used to hedge against underlying cash market positions
			- then show the hedge as the risk position being hedged and show this generation of some form of 'pseudo' cash movement in your reporting of cashflows you make for your cash market positions management
			- now it is usually dynamically updated with cashflows, mismatch reports and on-screen mtm evaluation.
			- usually need one or more systems to consolidate cross market instruments and risks to identify etc.
		- trading
			- similar to fin IR futures when dealing on trading basis need to be readily accessible in a portfolio so that a dealer can when need be sell or buy back to contract to close the position (and realise the profit).
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">They get settled individually on settlement date and remain in portfolio until that date.</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If a FRA position is taken as a trading position it will be marked to market on a daily basis and any profit and loss will be taken into account immediately.</mark>
- Financial Futures
	- definition
		- agreement to b/s standard amount of specified commodity/currency/instrument at **fixed** price on **fixed** future date
		- Sold on exchanges as either electronically or open outcry
		- can either go long or short on any day up until predefined last trading date
		- All standardised so readily traded until last trading date
	- CME started trading futures in IMM (international Money Market) (Money Market = liquid short term market)
		- CME Group represents the merger of the **Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)**, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), the **New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)** and its commodity exchange division, Commodity Exchange, Inc. (COMEX). The merger was completed in 2007.
	- Open outcry = via voice and hand signals on trading floor
	- Screen based / electronically is now more available and used.
	- ICE
		- **LIFFE** = London International Financial Futures Exchange, later merged with **LTOM** (London Traded Options Market) in 2013
			- took over NYSE Euronext
			- started off as Open Outcry but then evolved to electronic trading platform
			- Electronic trading platform = **ICE Connect**
			- Uses API's
	- Futures contracts can be taken off the market if unpopular like Eurodollar but then reintroduced later on IMM of CME and SGX
	- Delivery Dates
		- Typically on 4 quarter dates:
			- March
			- June
			- September
			- December
		- Run for 90 days from delivery date (3rd Wednesday)
		- So to hedge a June - Sep risk, you'd use a June Contract.
		- Current nearest dates = FRONT MONTHS
	- **STIR = SHORT TERM INTEREST RATE FUTURES**
	- Pricing of STIR's
		- Quoted on index basis (100 - IR)
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Inverse relationship to IR</mark>
			- When IR's are falling, futures price rise
			- When IR's are rising, futures price fall
			- ![[IMG-20260107130838667.png]]
		- With implied 3 months forward/forward interest rates (3 v. 6) at 5.00 p.c. the equivalent Futures price would be traded at around 95.00 (100 - 5.00). If forward/forward implied interest rates then fall to 4.00 p.c. the Futures price will rise to approximately 96.00.
		- Price of money in MMs is IR payable
		- The money markets deal in cash i.e. funds are delivered either value today (Sterling markets) or on spot date (Eurocurrency markets) for all deposits/loans effected today.
		- Futures prices can show the markets expectations for similar cash deposits for 3m periods in the future from those quarter month delivery dates.
		- can be used to determine yield curves for IRs

	- Role of London Clearing House (ICE Clear (ICEU))
		- ICE Clear was formerly known as *LCH.Clearnet* and *ICCH (the International Commodities Clearing House)*. Screen based trading systems such as ICE CONNECT are automatically linked into Clearing systems.
		- Once the system has matched all trades the Clearing House assumes the role of second party to all trades, **becoming buyer to each seller and seller to each buyer.**
			- This eliminates credit risk for the exchange's clearing members as well as facilitating the process of entering into and closing out transactions.
		- Once the trades have been agreed between the Clearing House and the clearing member (normally early the next day) the Clearing House will effectively issue the guarantee of performance.
	- Margining
		- Initial Margin
			- Deposit like a minimum security deposit
			- level of IM is determined/standardised by contract and set by CH
		- Variation Margin
			- each member working with CH will have their net open position marked to market daily by the CH at the market's official closing price
			- The difference between the value at the closing price and the original value, must be paid to / or will be received from the clearing house by the clearing member as **variation margin**.
			- You'll receive margin calls on valuation of your account following this process by 10am the next day
			- It is a zero sum with one trader's profits netting the other's losses on marking to market of all individual positions on a daily basis.
			- Done via LCH Clearnet Protected Payments System **PPS**
			- *example below*
	- Ticks
		- A tick is the minimum price movement on the contract as defined by the exchange and can vary from contract to contract
			- e.g. SONIA tick value = 0.01 which translates to (GBP 12.50)
			- could also be 0.005 = USD 12.5
		- easier to deal in the 0.01 movement so easer for margin calculations regardless of tick size
		- ![[IMG-20260107130853423.png|500]]
		- rather use 1 points so if tick size is 0.005 = 12.5 then 1 point would be 0.01 = 25
		- variation margin example:
			- ![[IMG-20260107130855112.png]]
	- STIR Delivery
		- doesn't happen
		- if still outstanding then the exchange settles things in cash at 11.am on final trading date at EDSP
	- EDSP
		- Exchange Delivery Settlement Price
	- **Uses of futures**
		- Financial Futures may be used in risk management strategies to protect the capital value of equity and fixed interest portfolios in a rising interest rate environment. In a similar way, yields on short-term investments can be protected during periods of falling interest rates
		- 3 main
			- hedging
				- A hedge is a temporary substitute for a known future requirement. Essentially it involves taking a futures position that is equal and opposite to an existing or anticipated position in the cash market.
			- trading
				- Trading is buying and selling futures with the aim of making a profit. It allows an investor to take a view on the cash market's direction without having to buy or sell the underlying financial instrument.
				- *adds liquidity to the market bc of volume of traders*
			- arbitrage

# Chapter 8 FICC Derivatives (Options)

> [!note] Not taking notes on theory, just on calculations

Clearing House which stands as buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer.

As an example a market maker when asked for a price in a 3 month EUR Call/USD Put (American style) with a strike price of 1.6500 might quote 10 - 10 ¼ p.c. This is his estimate of what implied volatility will be over the option time to expiry. The market user then decides whether this is in line with or differs from his own view. If the market user believes volatility will be lower he sells (volatility) to the market 351 maker’s bid of 10 p.c. If he believes volatility will be higher than 10 ¼ p.c. he buys (volatility). Once this has been agreed the buyer of volatility is the buyer of the option and the Premium is then calculated using all data elements now available. On agreement of the transaction the Premium is then payable (on deal date) by the buyer to the seller.

Price may be in another currency even if it's EUR call / USD put

Break even:
 For the holder of a Call this is the strike price plus premium paid (points in rate). For the holder of a Put this is the Strike price less the premium paid (points in rate).

An ITM option will ALWAYS be exercised. An OTM option will not be exercised and is described as expiring “worthless”. On exercise an OTC Currency option becomes a standard Spot foreign exchange transaction between the two parties and is then subject to routine credit risk concerns (i.e. delivery risk).

For example, if a change of 1 percent in the exchange rate causes the currency option premium to change by 0.5 percent then the delta is described as being 0.5

The Delta represents the speed with which an option price will change relative to the underlying. It gives an idea of the probability that the option will be In-the- money at expiry. It can be described as the option’s “pay-off”.

Delta is a ratio between 0-1
ATM -> 0.5
ITM -> close to 1
OTM -> close to 0 Small changes in the price of the underlying will not alter the Premium.

delta -> velocity
gamma -> acceleration
volacity is how fast you're going
acceleration is how fast you're speeding up

Gamma will be large when an option is at-the-money and near to expiry. Gamma will be small, near to zero, when either an in- or out-of-the-money option is nearing expiry date.
Options with a high Gamma ratio will be attractive to option buyers, but less attractive to option sellers. High Gammas mean fast, accelerating changes in Delta, thus options going in-the-money accelerate sellers’ losses and purchasers’ gains.

Options with a high Gamma ratio will be attractive to option buyers, but less attractive to option sellers. High Gammas mean fast, accelerating changes in Delta, thus options going in-the-money accelerate sellers’ losses and purchasers’ gains.

![[IMG-20260107130858411.png]]

If a currency option has a Vega of 0.05 and implied volatility in the underlying is 10 percent then if volatility were to change by 1 percent (moving up to 11 percent) the premium on the currency option would change by 0.05 percent.
(ratio: so if change in vol is 1, and vega is change in price/ change in vol = 0.05)

derivatives are the gradient to the function
e.g. y = mx + c

so e.g delta = (S1 - S2) / (v1 - v2)

 0.05 = (change)`x`S/(11-10)
(11-10)`*`0.05=  (change)`x`S
![[IMG-20260107130900180.png]]

Hedging:
But what about the bank dealer? Having sold the right to exercise to the customer how can he himself manage the risk now assumed from the customer?


Delta hedging: [[IMG-20260107130453166.pdf#page=359&selection=99,0,100,6|ACI Textbook1, page 359]]
- sell and buy to match delta ratio
- Call is at 10 million to get delta ratio of 0.5 he buys 5 million
	goes up to 0.7 so buys 2million to get to 7 million
	goes down to 0.5 so he sells the 2 million (going up and going down is the exchange rate in the market (St))
	We multiply these cashflows by the exchange rates
	so when he bought the extra 2million to get to 7 million at the exchange rate (2 million USD for 1.5600 EUR = USD 3,120,00). Then he sold it at the lower exchange rate when the delta went back down to 0.5 (2 million USD for 1.5500 EUR = USD 3,100,00 is what he got back when he paid 20,000USD more)

-> 
- calculating time value
	- ![[IMG-20260107130902247.png]]
	- here because the put is in the money (higher than the market price) and it's value is intrinsic + time, and it's up by 100, and it's price is 0.0125, we can deduce that it's time value is 0.0025 because it's intrinsic value is 100 (1.5600-1.5500) so it's 0.0025 (0.0125 - 0.0100)

A long (overbought) position in a currency which rises against the comparator currency will result in a profit, whereas a short position in such a currency will result in a loss. This is the risk and there are limits used in a bank to control and monitor this risk.

- Market Risk (market by market and product by product)
	- FX risk
		- transaction exposure
			- For example a UK exporter invoicing in foreign currency and being paid by his customers abroad in foreign currency has an exchange risk against local currency (GBP) with every export order (transaction) he fills and for which he issues an invoice. **The company has three choices**:
				- to cover (sell) the risk – by dealing with a bank in the traditional foreign exchange cash market,
				- to hedge (insure against) the risk – by using treasury derivatives such as currency options
				- or to run the risk. Provided the risk has been identified and the management are happy then running the risk can be considered a risk management decision.
		- translation exposure
			- reported as one currency in the balance sheet but different elsewhere
		- Economic exposure
			- Economic risk may be mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange or Currency options hedging strategies.
			- May arise when dealing with countries with different interest rates or exchanges and have your competitors in different countries using different exchange rates
	- MR - Cash foreign exchange instruments
		- financial institution exchange exposure
		- Market risk position limits
		- central bank limits / in-bank limits
			- banks limited by central bank
			- referred to as *Overnight Open Exchange Position Limit*
			- Managed by Risk Management Department
		- exchange risk
			- Comes from "Open Exchange Positions" and fact that exchanges fluctuate
			- **definition:**
				- The open exchange position can be defined as the difference between total assets and total liabilities, regardless of value date, in any currency, or pair of, or group of currencies. Here the bank will include assets and liabilities which are not all dealer initiated, i.e. interest accrual positions in foreign currencies
				- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Long (overbought) position in a currency which rises against the comparator currency will result in a profit, whereas a short position in such a currency will result in a loss. This is the risk and there are limits used in a bank to control and monitor this risk.</mark>
		- open exchange position limits
			- intra-day limits
				- "daylight" positions
				- limits positions during the day
				- can be multiple of Overnight limit
			- overnight position limits
				- "close of day"
					- Depends on:
						- on balance sheet,
						- local market size, 
						- business involvement,
						- risk management policies,
						- dealers’ experience etc.
				- Limits may be expressed as being on "net short basis"
					- the sum of all short currency positions (this is to avoid double counting)
				- Controlled by treasury division
				- 
			- FO, MO, BO reconciliation of overnight positions
				- BO responsibility to ensure all risk positions are reconciled:
					- Dealer's records to "Books of Account" and or other management info returns on daily basis
			- time zone risk
				- FX market on 24h basis
				- differences between the different markets opening and closing at different times
			- position passing / stop loss / take profit orders
	- MR - Forward Foreign exchange - Interest Rate risk
		- Forward foreign exchange trading is effectively trading interest rate differential “off the balance sheet”.
		- MR Position limits - Forward foreign exchange
		- Interest rate risk is the same as or equal to the interest rate differentials between the 2 currencies involved.
			- It comes as a result from the maintenance of the mismatch (gaps) of maturity positions of cash market **spot** against **forward** purchases and sales. Such as for foreign currency pairs  and off-balance sheet derivative products like n-d-fs and all are effective on a forward/forward basis.
			- It's measured per currency pair, per currency and on a consolidated basis with spot exchange positions and interest arbitrage operations included such as money market balancing items in the Mismatch (Gap) reporting where deemed appropriate.
			- Another good approach is to use a similar one to money market interest rate risk
	- MR - FICC Derivatives (Exchange traded Currency Options)
		- market risk comes from the underlying exchange rate or interest rate having volatility which fluctuates due to adverse market conditions
		- with options,
			- Buyers: the potential loss is limited to the premium and the upside is (potentially) unlimited
			- Sellers (writers): the potential loss is unlimited and the profit is limited to the premium (margin)
		- long/overbought call (*put*) on a commodity/currency/IR where option price (premium/margin) rises will result in a profit (*loss*)
	- MR - FICC Derivatives (OTC Currency / interest rate options)
		- same risk with positions like described above
		- hedging method = delta hedging for sold/written options using a computed model which looks at the proportion of cover in the underlying (be it cash or security) market required given your current position in the market and also looking at trends. But these hedging methods in themselves also give risk to further risks (both credit and market risks) in those underlying markets
		- Trading limits help with this both on trading and on hedging positions
	- MR - Commodities (Precious Metals)
		- commodity risk **definition**: relates to commodity prices (Precious metals, corn, copper, crude oil etc.)
			- main risk is that their implied vol will change
		- positions can be controlled in similar way to FX position risk
	- MR - Cash Money Market and financial instruments
		- main risk in CMM is interest rate risk: is that the dealer has a short (overlent) position in the fixed periods and interest rates rise or the dealer has a long (overborrowed) position in the fixed periods and interest rates fall
		- Overall market risk (interest rate risk) is defined and managed by the allocation of Mismatch (Gap) limits
		- It happens for unmatched/uncovered positions in financial instruments from CH5:
			- Treasury Bills
			- Bankers Acceptances (BAs)
			- Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
			- Commercial Papers (CP)
		- Again trading limits on positions help
	- MR - FICC Derivatives (Short term Interest rate)
		- MR - FRA's
			- similar to open exchange positions
			- market risk depends on price vol of currency being traded
			- hedging or trading bases can either create or cover IR risk
			- When hedging FRAs if off-balance sheet derivatives then it must be consolidated into the cash market reporting so it can be used to assess overall interest rate risk
			- They don't offset liquidity risk
			- Considered **Contract for difference**
				- calculated on settlement date (**fixing date**)
			- Re-investment risk in that the settlement rate being used as the discount rate may not be achieved on re-investment
			- trading limits again
		- MR - Financial Futures
			- transactions can be effected as trading positions and are subject to MR like open exchange positions.
			- Degree depends on price vol of underlying.
			- Risks are reflected in initial margin requirements
			- Can be used for hedging or trading
			- If hedging, it is off-balance sheet and must be included in cash market report to assess overall IR risk
			- Trading limits again
	- MR - Longer-term IRS (but including OIS)
		- MR when swaps are unmatched (warehoused) 
		- by traders awaiting the fixed payer client having already closed a swap with a fixed receiver. 
		- Exposed to underlying long term bond or markets
		- also swap spreads quoted in interbank market
		- risk is only gone once the unmatched position has been closed as exactly matched (payment flow dates)
		- Due to nature usually imperfectly matched
		- Can use duration analysis like for bonds
	- Other
		- IR risk from mismatched maturity positions of cash market assets, libabilities and off-balance sheet derivative products as well as outstanding commitments to lend or borrow (forward/forward) at agreed **fixed interest rates**
			- basically you're at risk when you've fixed something  at an interest rate
		- The interest variation date of variable interest rate operations (e.g. at 2 days notice or at “Prime rate”) must be regarded as the next business day when a change may occur.
		- can evaluate positions by comparing historic (break even) and current MtM rates of interest either from today (i.e. spot) or on a forward/forward basis.
		- P&L can be evaluated on accrual basis then discounted back to today's value using normal NPV techniques
		- Can also use a "What-if" report
		- Mismatch limits
			- limits put in place to limit their ability to create mismatch positions
			- The limits can be an absolute maximum amount which must not be exceeded within a pre-agreed time horizon (frequently one year) or can be controlled by a maximum cumulative total of all mismatch positions which must not occur later than a date linked to the liquidity of the currency market involved or profitability or some other measure. 
- Credit Risk (Market by market and product by product)
	- CR - Spot foreign exchange
		- Delivery risk (Herstatt risk)
			- Foreign exchange market = cash market
			- on value date, currencies involved must be physically delivered as agreed upon as per the contract
			- If the bank doesn't receive the currency in the contract and has already paid the countervalue (the other side of the currency be it the foreign one or the local one) then the risk is 100% of what was already paid away
			- It's a daily risk assessment of both spot and forward outstandings
			- The risk department limits with with a single metric -> "delivery risk limit" when it creates counterparty credit limits
			- delivery risk may also arise due to middle eastern markets due to differing Islamic weekend/holiday dates
			- bilateral netting and CLS reduce impact of this risk
			- **payment netting reduces settlement risk**
				- f counterparties are to exchange multiple cash on any value date, they can agree to net those cash flows to one payment per currency. Not only does such payment netting reduce settlement risk, it also economises on processing procedures.
	- CR - Forward foreign exchange
		- Cash market
		- also subject to Delivery risk
			- If, in a non CLS currency or a transaction with a non CLS counterparty, for some reason the bank does not receive the currency contracted to be purchased and has already paid away the countervalue in local or another foreign currency then the risk is 100% of the sums so paid away.
		- Market replacement risk
			- additional Credit risk in forward foreign exchange
			- this is where if like in credit risk, a counterparty defaults, not only on top of that but now to replace their positions you're also subject to changes in interest rates and exchange rates
			- A transaction is only completed by the receiver in Mega Bank if it results in a profit against replacement at the current market rate. If the transaction results in a profit to Major Bank (Loss to the receiver) this contract will more than likely NOT be completed. If the transaction results in a profit to the receiver this contract will be completed – this is assessed as “zero” risk. This process is referred to in legal terms as specific performance or “cherry picking” and results in asymmetric risk.
			- you basically look at the exchange rates in the contract and see whether doing it in the market would be more favourable or not
			- if it's less favourable, you're subject to market replacement risk (they offered you a lower rate, or a higher rate) and that difference is then your market replacement risk
		- CR mitigation techniques Foreign Exchange FX
		- netting
			- reduces credit exposure and processing and payment costs
			- These netting arrangements only apply to foreign exchange transactions in the same currency pairings dealt for the same value date and the terms of all such netting are agreed bilaterally between the banks.
			- helps with market replacement risk (see above)
			- This risk does not disappear if default of the counterparty means a potential “profit” i.e. a better rate than contractually agreed is then available. The concept of “specific performance” with the receiver in bankruptcy being able to decide which contracts to complete means that transactions resulting in a profit to the defaulting party would be completed and those resulting in a loss would be allowed to fail. Netting by novation is one way to reduce this market replacement risk.
			- Close-out netting
				- Reduces pre-settlement risk
				- negates "cherry picking"
			- CLS
				- *Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) is an industry initiative to reduce the risks associated with cross-currency transactions. These risks have been principally caused by delays due to time-zone differences. CLS is a real-time system that enables simultaneous settlement globally, irrespective of time zones, within a five-hour timeframe in Europe.*
				- Pro's
					- Eliminates settlement risk
					- improves liquidity management
					- reduces operational banking costs
					- improves operational efficiency and effectiveness
				- CLS Bank
					- in NY supervised by Fed
					- works with central banks
					- members:
						- Settlement members
						- User members
							- don't have a direct account but are sponsored by a settlement member acting on its behalf
						- Third parties
							- customers of both
							- other members handle all instructions
						- Each day members submit instructions (like SSI's) to CLS bank
					- All Members input and manage their instructions. Settlement Members make their payments to CLS Bank, and monitor their settlement and account positions. Members receive real-time operational information and manage their own data.
					- CLS Bank reduces the risk of a Member losing the principal relating to an FX transaction from paying away one currency and failing to receive the countercurrency. Unlike the Futures Markets clearing houses CLS Bank does not guarantee the settlement of every instruction that is submitted for settlement, nor provide protection against the failure of forward trades nor become a counterparty to any underlying cross-currency transaction, however, once an instruction is settled, CLS Bank ensures that each Member will receive the payment to which it is entitled from CLS Bank in accordance with its rules and risk management procedures.
				- Benefits achieved through STP, improving credit management and liquidity consolidation
				- also improves the availability and flow of funds
				- How it works
					- Copy of MT300 FX confirmation within 2 hours of deal being struck, transaction is to be settled via CLS by both banks directly to the CLS bank
					- CLS Bank issues the net amounts owed by the member and the members manage their own instructions and update their accounts and make payments to the CLS bank, monitoring their settlement and account positions. They get real-time data for this.
					- CLS Bank reduces the risk of a Member losing the principal relating to an FX transaction from paying away one currency and failing to receive the other currency (delivery or ‘Herstatt’ risk)
					- **DIFFERENCES TO FUTURES MARKET CLEARING HOUSES**
						- *does not guarantee* the settlement of every instruction submitted or provide protection against failure of forward trades or become a counterparty to any underlying cross-currency transaction. However, once an instruction is settled, CLS Bank will assure that each member will receive the payment to their due according to their rules and risk management procedures.

					- CLS Bank has pre-arranged liquidity facilities with the Central Banks in the currencies it handles, so, if one of the Settlement Members fails to pay (a failed payment rather than a ‘default’), CLS Bank will sell the currency received from the non-defaulting bank to one of its liquidity providers for the countercurrency, and then pay the countercurrency to the non-defaulting bank
					- MT300 FX SWIFT confirmations are transmitted to CLS Bank on deal date
					- In case where one party fails, the party who does pay will get their counter currency payment but the other party will get nothing and this is facilitated because CLS bank has ties to central banks which have reserves in major currencies
				- Inside/Outside Swaps
					- another service provided by CLS
					- An I/O Swap comprises two equal and opposite FX transactions that are agreed as an intraday swap. This reduces intraday cash flows while leaving the institution's overall FX position unchanged. I/O Swaps exploit the likelihood that an institution with a large short position in-CLS will almost certainly have one or more large long positions in-CLS.
					- can match liquidity flows to domestic needs as well as to CLS system
					- Currencies = G20's ISO (SWIFT) currency codes
	- CR (and Counterparty Dealing Limits) - Money Market
		- The credit risk in Money market Cash transactions is relatively easy to identify. If you have lent unsecured money the risk is that the counterparty will go bankrupt before maturity date and you will not receive back the amount of your advance.
		- **Loans** The credit risk is in the name of the borrower of cash.
	- CR (and Counterparty Dealing Limits) - Financial Instruments
		- **Repos**
			- The credit risk is on the issuer of the collateral (typically government securities therefore typically lower risk than comparator commercial collateral transactions).
		- **T-Bills**
			- The credit risk is in the name of the government issuer (typically lower risk than comparator commercial issues).
		- **Eligible Bills / Bankers Acceptances**
			- The credit risk is in the name of the Acceptor (guarantor)
		- **CDs Purchased at Issue**
			- The credit risk is in the name of the issuer of the CD.
		- **Secondary CDs purchased**
			- The credit risk is in the name of the issuer of the CD. In certain financial centres where physical settlement of such instruments takes place, there is also a delivery risk in the name of the seller of the CD between the date of payment and receipt of the financial instrument purchased.
		- **Commercial Paper**
			- The credit risk is in the name of the issuing company i.e. Commercial risk or, in some countries, financial institution.
		- **Central Securities Depositories (CSDs)**
			- There are currently around 30 central securities depositories (CSD) in the European Union. Euroclear (Belgium) and Clearstream (Luxembourg) act as depositories for international securities and have their own account in most CSDs in Europe and beyond. These entities are referred to as CCPs (Central Clearing Counterparties) within the Basel rules.
		- In all transactions which involve exchanging cash for security/collateral you're subjected to delivery risk (daylight or intra-day) on purchases.
			- Between payment and confirmation
			- between clearing houses
			- between instructions through agents
			- from confirmation of receipt of cash in payment
	- CR - FICC Derivatives
		- FRAs
			- Market replacement risk
			- Due to counterparty credit risk (counterparty defaults/fails before settlement)
				- i) a market replacement cost, a substitute FRA arranged at an unfavourable rate judged against the original transaction.
				- ii) if a replacement FRA cannot be arranged, full exposure to any adverse movements in interest rates against which the original FRA was initiated.
			- relates to vol of IR in cash market
				- assessed daily on MtM basis
				- (a negative market to market, i.e. the bank owes the counterparty = nil risk). Some banks may still assess risk on FRAs as a flat percentage (i.e. 5% maximum potential interest rate swing in any period where there is an FRA outstanding).
		- Financial Futures (STIR contracts)
			- **NO CREDIT RISK**
				- This is because of the Exchange of Clearing House
					- *Where the CH becomes buyer to every seller and seller to every buyer*
				- Because of the total lack of credit risk, Financial Futures are the only financial trading product which is *not subject to Capital Adequacy requirements.*
		- IRS (including OIS)
			- Have credit risk on the counterparty, reflects market replacement risk (and costs associated)
			- Market replacement risk
				- If the counterparty defaults during life of the swap, the bank will be left with their position which may be covered at a loss. Position could be in foreign exchange positions or interest rate positions
				- Swaps should be MtM on regular basis to reflect market replacement risk and effected preferably daily.
				- Counterparties aren't usually aware of each other's identities
					- bank assumes credit risk of each counterparty unless acts as just a broker
				- Given the long term nature of swaps banks must pay greater attention to increased risk the longer the period remaining to maturity of any transaction. Many banks use a sliding scale to assess credit risk on swaps based on historic analysis of movements in interest rates. Further percentage credit utilisation measures may be applied where the currenc(ies) involved are not traded in the major international markets.
				- Currency and IR swaps are subject to exchange rate volatility which can lead to a higher replacement cost on default
				- **Factors affecting credit risk**
					- Overall level of interest rates
					- Collateral
					- Reset frequency
						- more frequent, easy to identify if counterparty will default
					- Shape of yield curve
						- if currently positive then the probability is that floating rates will rise meaning that the floating rate payer (fixed rate receiver)’s liability will increase in the future.
	- Delivery risk - IRS
		- risks rise when:
			- i) dates of receipts and payments of fixed and floating interest flows may **differ** and the counterparty fails to make a payment after receiving funds from the bank
			- ii) a counterparty accepts payment to it but fails to make payment to the bank on the same day. This risk applies **mainly to currency swaps** since payments in the same currency on an interest rate swap are usually netted.
			- iii) in respect of currency swaps, the final exchange of currencies at an exchange rate agreed several years previously could lead to substantial **exchange exposure**
	- CR Mitigation
		- Some ways are netting and collateral otherwise credit derivatives
	- Credit Derivatives
		- A credit derivative is another means of **credit mitigation** allowing the lender to effectively **transfer risk** of a debtor defaulting to a third party. This third party, as in **insurance** policy **accepts some or all the risk in return for payment**, known as the **premium**.
		- CDS
			- **definition:**
				- A credit default swap (CDS) is a financial derivative whereby an investor "swaps" or offsets his credit risk in a bilateral OTC contract with another investor.
			- If lender is concerned their counterparty will default, they can enter a CDS with someone else (transferring the credit risk to an insurer at a premium)
			- The lender **buys** a CDS from 3rd party who then agrees to **reimburse** the lender should their counterparty (borrower) default
			- Different parties:
				- Lender/Borrower
				- Buyer/Seller
				- The Lender (A) of the security/loan/etc. is the one at risk to the borrower (B) (counterparty) and would be the one to **buy** the CDS (therefore be the **buyer**)
				- the **Seller** (C) is therefore the 3rd party and the **insurer**
				- A = Lender and Buyer
				- B = Borrower
				- C = Seller and Insurer
				- A buys CDS from C to protect from B defaulting
		- TRS
			- A Total return swap is a swap which permits a counterparty (receiver) to achieve the risk and return on an asset without actually owning it. In exchange this party must pay an agreed rate (fixed, floating or variable) over the life of the swap. The receiver assumes the credit risk, whereas the payer takes on the credit exposure the receiver may be subject to. An example is USD floating rate v. S&P 500 index on an agreed investment amount.
			-  Own Note: [[Total Return Swap (TRS)]]
		- CDO
			- Structured like with tranches
			- Based on pool of cash loans/other assets and then sold to investors
			- Becomes collateral if loan defaults (Big Short)
	- CVA
		- Credit Value Adjustment is the difference between the risk-free portfolio value and the true (mark to market) portfolio value that takes into account the possibility of a counterparty’s default. CVA is the market value of counterparty credit risk.
- Documentation
	- Cash Markets (i.e. FX and MM) have "My word is my bond" don't have enough documentation.
		- So in last few years have gathered standard terms and conditions governing each of these instruments especially with rise of derivatives in OTC markets
	- FXC
		- cover close-out netting provisions and transaction payments legal terms
		- FEOMA (1997)
		- IFEMA
			- exchange transactions
		- ICOM Master Agreement
			- currency option transactions
		- IFXCO Master Agreement
			- updates others by including FX and currency options definitions according to Global Documentation Steering Committee
		- FEOMA combines IFEMA and ICOM Master agreements
	- GMRA
		- global master repurchase agreement
		- for repos
		- Published by International Capital Market Association (ICMA)
		- which is the body representing the cross-border bond and repo markets in Europe
		- published by PSA (Public Securities Association) now TBMA (The Bond Market Association)
		- good for classic repos
		- pre-sign GMRA
			- then transactions are referred back to bi-lateral agreement
		- sets out procedures for 
			- margining
			- events of default
			- also range of definitions of terminology
	- ISDA
		- International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreements
		- 1992
		- Covers all rates market derivative products.
		- 2 types:
			- 1. local
			- 2. Multi-currency cross-border
		- A Credit Support Annex is a legal document which regulates the collateral used in Derivative transactions. It is one of the four parts that make up an ISDA Master Agreement but is not mandatory.
	- ISDA Credit Support Annex (CSA)
		- defines terms under which collateral is posted / transferred between *swap* counterparties to mitigate credit risk coming from "in the money" derivative positions
		- *If on any Valuation Date, the Delivery Amount equals or exceeds the Pledgor's Minimum Transfer Amount, the Pledgor must transfer Eligible Collateral with a Value at least equal to the Delivery Amount.*
			- The Delivery Amount is the amount the Credit Support Amount exceeds the Value of all posted Collateral held by the Secured Party.
		- The Collateral must meet the **Eligibility criteria** in the agreement,
			- e.g., which currencies it may be in, what types of bonds are allowed, and which, if any, haircuts are applied.
		- There are also rules for the settlement of disputes arising over valuation of derivative positions.
		- To distinguish between the Schedule to the Master Agreement and the Credit Support Annex, the schedules are numbered as Parts and CSA are numbered as Paragraphs.
		- Under English Law, CSA are considered transactions: Any collateral listed as ‘Eligible Collateral’ is **delivered as an outright transfer of title.**
			- The collateral taker becomes the outright owner of that collateral free of any third party interest.
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">An English law credit support annex operates by way of outright transfers of title to the posted collateral whereas parties transacting business under a New York CSA can materially change the parties’ rights and obligations and their standing upon an insolvency of the other party giving rise to Legal risk. (See later in this chapter).</mark>
- Operational Risk
	- **Definition**
		- In 2004 the Basel Committee initially defined Operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. The committee indicates that this definition **excludes systemic risk, legal risk and reputational risk**
		- After downfall of big companies regulators decided to focus on risks other than Credit Risk and Market Risk
	- **Includes:**
		- employee errors, (e.g. fat-finger trading errors, reconciliation failings)
		- model mis-use or mal-functions, (e.g. incorrect or erroneously programmed algorithms)
		- communication failures, (e.g. telephone, lack of rates information, trading platform outages etc.)
		- IT systems failures, (e.g. in-house systems problems - processing and/or reporting)
		- fire, floods or other losses to physical assets,
		- fraud or other criminal activity (including rogue trading)
- Legal Risk
	- Legal risk is risk from uncertainty due to legal actions or uncertainty in the applicability or interpretation of contracts, laws or regulations. Depending on an institution's circumstances, legal risk may entail such issues as Contract formation i.e. what constitutes a legitimate contract? Is an oral agreement sufficient, or must there be a legal document? What documentation is required? Does a counterparty have the capacity to enter into a transaction?
	- If transacting across borders, subject to more jurisdictions and risk on who becomes the authority over a legal issue
- Reputational Risk
	- Based on trust
	- Takes forever to build, can be lost instantly
	- Loss of confidence by any group of market counterparties can quickly lead to the decline of a bank with credit lines reduced or withdrawn making the bank’s funding more difficult or more expensive.
	- Reputational risk management is supported by "the plans, processes and practices, which engender and sustain the trust of all and each category of market counterparties".
- Other risks
	- Specific Risk ("unsystematic risk")
		- In a balanced portfolio of assets there'd be a spread between general market risk and risks specific to individual components of that portfolio. Determination of the extent of exposure to individual risks is made using models such as Treynor-Black in which the optimal share of a security is inversely proportional to the square of its specific risk.
	- Systemic Risk
		- Systemic risk is a means to describe the likelihood of the collapse of *a* financial system, such as a general stock market crash or a joint breakdown of the banking system.
		- **Systemic risk != systematic risk**
			- Systematic risk = whole economy like business cycles or wars
	- SIFI 
		- Systematically Important Financial Institution
			- bank/insurance company or fin institution which failure might cause a crisis
			- "too big to fail"
	- Wrong way risk
		- defined by ISDA as the risk that occurs when "exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty
		- When default risk and credit exposure increase together
		- Ordinarily in trading book credit risk measurement, the creditworthiness of the counterparty and the exposure of a transaction are measured and modelled independently. An example of wrong way risk is where credit derivatives are being used to protect against counterparty default the counterparty’s subsequent default impacts the creditworthiness of the seller of the credit insurance (derivative).
- Basel Accords (Basel I to Basel III)
	- Basel I is a set of international banking regulations put forward by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision that sets out the minimum capital requirements of financial institutions with the goal of minimizing credit risk
	- G10 got together
	- Started with Cooke Ratio
	- Together are called "Basel Accords"
	- Basel III recommendations were originally scheduled to be introduced from 2013 until 2015; however, implementation was extended repeatedly to 31st March 2019 and then again until 1st January 2022.
	- Tiers
		- Tier 1
			- Tier 1 Capital (“core” capital) consists of equity and disclosed reserves.
			- Secure capital to absorb losses in case of defaults so it gets absorbed by the reserve instead of earnings
		- Tier 2
			- Tier 2 Capital (“supplementary” capital) includes perpetual securities, undisclosed reserves, subordinated debt over 5 years to maturity and shares redeemable at the option of the issuer.
	- BIS ratio
		- Of the BIS Ratio for Capital cover of 8 percent at least 50 percent must be Tier 1 Capital. All classes of assets are risk weighted according to asset classes and counterparty (OECD government to non-OECD non financial counterparty). As the perceived credit risk increases so too does the risk weighting.
	- Trading Book
		- 3 criteria:
			- that the instrument is a financial instrument
			- *…and* that the instrument is held for trading purposes
			- *…or* that the instrument is hedging an exposure in the trading book.
		- Instruments included:
			-  transferable securities,
			- money market instruments,
			- financial futures contracts,
			- FRAs,
			- interest rate swaps,
			- currency swaps
			- and options to acquire these instruments.
		- Definition:
			- proprietary positions in financial instruments which are held for resale and/or which are taken on by the institution with the intention of benefiting in the short term from actual and/or expected differences between their buying and selling prices or positions taken in order to hedge other elements of the trading book
			- exposures due to the unsettled transactions, free deliveries and OTC derivative instruments, exposures due to repurchase agreements (Repos) and securities lending
			- those exposures in the form of fees, commission, interest, dividends and margin on exchange traded derivatives In the UK, positions are considered to be held with a trading intent if:.. 
			- they are marked to market daily as part of the internal risk management process - the position takers have autonomy in entering into transactions within predetermined limits
			- they satisfy any other criteria which the bank applies to the composition of its trading book on a consistent basis.
	- CAD II
		- CAD II is the EU directive that allows financial institutions to use internal VaR models to calculate market risk capital requirements in line with BIS Basel standards. Banks must measure Delta, Gamma and Vega risk when calculating Capital adequacy required against written (Sold) Options positions. VAR is an acceptable measure of risk for assessment of BIS capital adequacy calculations and other central bank imposed risk measures.
		- Can also choose SA
		- Lays down basic standards for in-house (IM) models
			- The model must express a VaR estimate to a 99% confidence level, must calculate losses on the basis of a 10 day holding period and all historic data used must cover at least the last 12 months
	- Basel II differences
		- Brought in 3 pillars
		- more reflective of underlying risks in banking.
		- Better incentives
		- Built on the previous one to point to risks that banks actually face
			- This was achieved in part by aligning capital requirements more *closely to the risk of credit loss* and by introducing a new capital charge for exposures to the risk of loss caused by *operational failures*.
		- Pillars
			- Summary:
				- **Pillar I -> Minimum Capital Requirements**
				- **Pillar II -> Supervisory Review**
				- **Pillar III -> Market Discipline**
			- Pillar I - Minimum capital requirements
				- Pillar I presents the calculation of the total minimum capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk
				- The capital ratio is calculated using the definition of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets. The total capital ratio must be no lower than 8%. Tier 2 capital is limited to 100% of Tier 1 capital.
				- Definition of "Eligible Capital" is still the same as Basel I
				- Under the standardised approach to credit risk, general provisions can be included in Tier 2 capital subject to the limit of 1.25% of risk weighted assets. Under the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, the treatment of the 1988 Accord to include general provisions (or general loan-loss reserves) in Tier 2 capital is withdrawn. The definition of Tier 3 capital as set out in the Amendment to the Capital Accord to Incorporate Market Risks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (January 1996, modified September 1997, in this Framework referred to as the Market Risk Amendment) remains unchanged.
			- Basel III
				- Basel III, the global regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk agreed upon by members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2010 was developed in response to the deficiencies in financial regulation revealed by the 2008 financial crisis. Basel III strengthens bank capital requirements and introduces new regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and bank leverage.
				- Definitions and calculations:
					- B III - Pillar 1:
						- aligns **minimum capital requirements** more closely to each bank's actual risk of economic loss
						- Risk-weighted assets under Basel II / III
							- Total risk-weighted assets under Basel II are determined by multiplying the capital requirements for market risk and operational risk by 12.5 (i.e. the reciprocal of the minimum capital ratio of 8%) and adding the resulting figures to the sum of risk-weighted assets for credit risk.
			- Pillar II - Supervisory Review
				- Pillar II covers the key principles of supervisory review, risk management, guidance and supervisory transparency and accountability produced by BIS with respect to banking risks, including guidance relating to, among other things, the treatment of interest rate risk in the banking book, credit risk (stress testing, definition of default, residual risk, and credit concentration risk), operational risk, enhanced cross-border communication and cooperation, and securitisation
				- Ensures banks are better developing and using better risk management techniques to monitor and manage their risks
				- Supervisors must evaluate how banks are assessing their capital based on their needs and risks and must know when to intervene
				- can't just rely on capital reserves, also need internal risk limits and controls
				- There are three main areas that might be particularly suited to treatment under Pillar II, risks considered under Pillar I that are not fully captured by the Pillar I process (e.g. credit concentration risk); those factors not taken into account by the Pillar I process (e.g. interest rate risk in the banking book, business and strategic risk); and factors external to the bank (e.g. business cycle effects).
				- A further important aspect of Pillar II is the assessment of compliance with the minimum standards and disclosure requirements of the more advanced methods in Pillar I, in particular the IRB framework for credit risk and the Advanced Measurement Approaches for operational risk.
				- Supervisors must ensure that these requirements are met, both as qualifying criteria and on a continuing basis.
				- Under Basel III - Pillar II bank supervisors must evaluate the activities and risk profiles of individual banks to determine whether those organisations should hold higher levels of capital than the minimum requirements in Pillar 1 would specify and to see whether there is any need for remedial actions.
			- Pillar III - Market Discipline
				- The rationale for Pillar III is sufficiently strong to warrant the introduction of disclosure requirements for banks using the Framework. Supervisors have an array of measures that they can use to require banks to make such disclosures. Some of these disclosures will be qualifying criteria for the use of particular methodologies or the recognition of particular instruments and transactions
				- Complements Pillar I and Pillar II
				- encourages market discipline with disclosure requirements
				- allows market participants to assess key pieces of information on:
					- the scope of application
					- capital
					- risk exposures
					- risk assessment processes
					- and hence the capital adequacy of the institution
				- BIS believes it's an effective way of getting each bank to inform the market of their exposure to those risks and allows for transparency and comparability
				- Basel III, Pillar 3 leverages the ability of market discipline to motivate prudent management by enhancing the degree of transparency in banks’ public reporting to shareholders and customers.
	- Probability of Default (PD)
		- Probability of default (PD) is the likelihood of a default over a particular time horizon.
		- Under Basel II:
			- a default event on a debt obligation is said to have occurred if... 
				- it is unlikely that the obligor will be able to repay its debt to the bank without giving up any pledged collateral
				- the obligor is more than 90 days past due on a material credit obligation
		- The PD is an estimate of the likelihood that the default event will occur over a fixed assessment horizon, usually taken to be one year. The PD can be estimated for a particular obligor which is the usual practice in wholesale banking, or for a segment of obligors sharing similar credit risk characteristics which is the usual practice in retail banking.
	- Exposure at Default (EAD)
		- Exposure at Default is an estimate of the extent to which a bank may be exposed to a counterparty in the event of, and at the time of, that counterparty’s default. EAD is equal to the current amount outstanding in case of fixed exposures like term loans. For revolving exposures like lines of credit, EAD can be divided into drawn and undrawn commitments.
		- Based on Basel II:
			- EAD measures the amount that is likely to be drawn further if a default occurs.
			- 2 terms for this are used (how expressed):
				- Conversion Factor (CF)
				- Loan Equivalent (LEQ)
			- While under foundation approach (F-IRB) calculation of EAD is guided by the regulators, under the advanced approach (A-IRB) banks enjoy greater flexibility on how they calculate EAD.
			- Calculation Under Foundation Approach (F-IRB)
				- Under F-IRB EAD is calculated taking account of the underlying asset, forward valuation, facility type and commitment details. This *value does not take account* of guarantees, collateral or security
					- (i.e. it ignores Credit Risk mitigation techniques with the exception of on-balance sheet netting where the effect of netting is included in Exposure at Default).
					- For on-balance sheet transactions, EAD is identical to the *nominal amount of exposure*. On-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits of a bank to a corporate counterparty is permitted to reduce the estimate of EAD under certain conditions.
					- For off-balance sheet items, there are two broad types which the IRB approach needs to address: 
						- transactions with uncertain future drawdown, such as commitments and revolving credits, 
						- and OTC foreign exchange, interest rate and equity derivative contracts
			- Calculation Under Advanced Approach (A-IRB)
				- Under A-IRB, the bank itself determines the appropriate EAD to be applied to each exposure.
				- (Internal EAD estimates)
				-  A bank using internal EAD estimates for capital purposes is able to differentiate EAD values on the *basis of a wider set of transaction characteristics* (e.g. product type) as well as borrower characteristics. These values would be expected to represent a conservative view of *long-run averages*, although banks are free to use more conservative estimates.
				- A bank wishing to use its own estimates of EAD will *need to demonstrate to its local Central Bank / regulator that it can meet additional minimum requirements pertinent to the integrity and reliability of these estimates.*
				- All estimates of EAD are calculated net of any specific provisions a bank may have raised against an exposure.
	- Loss given default (LGD)
		- **Definition:** Loss Given Default is percentage of loss over the total exposure when bank's counterparty goes to default
		-  It is facility-specific because such losses are generally understood to be influenced by key transaction characteristics:
			- such as the presence of collateral
			- and the degree of subordination.
		- Theoretically, LGD is calculated in different ways,
			- 'Gross' LGD, the favourite with academics, where total losses are divided by exposure at default (EAD)
			- or ‘Blanco’ LGD, preferred by banks because they have many secured facilities and would like to decompose their losses between losses on unsecured portions and losses on secured portions *due to depreciation of collateral quality*.
	- Capital Treatment of Credit Risk under Basel II and III
		- 3 approaches to credit risk under BII. The SA is simplest of the 3. The other 2 are based on internal ratings (IM)
		- Standardised Approach SA
			- avoids complexity
			- Risk Weights
				- Risk weighted assets under the Standardised Approach will continue to be calculated as the product of the amount of exposures and supervisory determined risk weight
				- As in the current Accord the risk weights will be determined by the category of the borrower, sovereign bank or corporate counterparty. There is now no distinction on the sovereign risk weighting depending on whether or not the sovereign is a member of OECD under Basel III.
		- **Basel III - Summary of changes from previous versions (earlier Accords)**
			- Minimum common equity requirement of 2% to 4.5%
			- Capital conservation buffer 2.5% - met with common equity. If under then there are greater constraints on earnings distributions are imposed
			- Total common equity requirement is 7%
			- Higher capital requirements for trading, derivatives and securitization
			- Tier 1 capital from 4% to 6% over the same period
			- Countercyclical buffer in the range of 0 to 2.5% of common equity according to national circumstances
			- **Introduction of Liquidity coverage ratio (LCD)**
			- **Introduction of Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)**
			- Supplemented by **non risk based leverage ratio**
		- Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)
			- The purpose of the ICAAP document is to inform the Board of an institution of the ongoing assessment of the firm’s risks, how the firm intends to mitigate those risks and how much current and future capital is necessary having considered other mitigating factors. The ICAAP document is also how the firm explains to the UK’s PRA (Prudential Regulation Authority) or its local regulator its internal capital adequacy assessment process.
		- Foundation internal ratings-based (F-IRB)
			- F stands for "Foundation"
				- so F-IRB
			- foundation internal ratings-based approach.
			- Refers to set of CR measurement techniques originally proposed under Basel II
			- Define their own capital adequacy rules for banking institutions
			- Banks can develop their own empirical models to estimate the PD (Probability of default) for individual clients or groups of clients.
		- Advanced internal rated based (A-IRB)
			- A-IRB = Advanced
			- set of credit risk measurement techniques by Basel II capital rules (adequacy) for banks.
			- Banks can develop their own models to calculate capital for credit risk.
			- Use their own models for":
				- PD
				- EAD
				- LGD
				- RWA (Risk weighted Assets)
				- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Then total capital required is calculated as fixed percentage of estimated RWA</mark>
- Liquidity Risk
	- Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
		- Under Basel III
		- Ensures bank holds enough liquid assets to cover short term crisis
		- based on predetermined set of cash inflows and outflows
		- **Pillar I ratio**
		- Must cover 30 stressed period and liquid assets in respect for lending must be available for drawdown within 30 d period.
		- **2 Categories of liquid assets [Level 1 & Level 2]**
			- **Level 1**
				- 100% of Qualifying marketable securities from sovereigns, central banks, public sector entities and multilateral development banks.
				- 100 % of Qualifying central bank reserves
				- 100 % of Domestic sovereign or central bank debt in domestic currency
				- 100 % of Domestic sovereign debt for non-0% risk weighted sovereigns, issued in foreign currency
			- **Level 2**
				- 85% of Sovereign, central bank, and PSE assets qualifying for 20% risk weighting
				- 85% of Qualifying corporate bonds rated AA- or higher
				- 85% of Qualifying covered bonds rated AA- or higher
		- Both Level 1 and Level 2 assets should “ideally” also be eligible for intraday or overnight liquidity facilities at central banks.
		- Level 2 assets have a specific quantitative benchmark to prove they are reliable during stressed conditions - a maximum price decline (or increase in haircut) over a stressed 30 day period not exceeding 10%.
		- Note: Assets and Liabilities are assessed for the purpose of the LCR currency by currency. For example Sterling liabilities need to be supported by Sterling assets.
