Stripping and stacking are risk management strategies used in futures trading, particularly in the context of interest rate futures. These strategies help traders manage exposure to interest rate movements over time.

### **1. Stripping of Futures (Rolling Hedge)**

Stripping refers to a strategy where a trader maintains a hedge by using a series of short-term futures contracts instead of a single long-term futures contract. The trader continuously replaces (or "rolls") expiring contracts with new ones of shorter maturity.

#### **How It Works:**

- Instead of buying or selling a long-dated futures contract, a trader enters into shorter-term futures contracts.
- As each contract nears expiration, it is closed, and a new contract is entered into for the next available period.
- This process is repeated continuously.

#### **Advantages:**

- Greater flexibility in adjusting positions based on market conditions.
- Less exposure to long-term interest rate fluctuations.

#### **Disadvantages:**

- Requires frequent monitoring and transaction costs due to rolling.
- Basis risk may arise if the new contracts are not perfectly aligned with the underlying exposure.

### **2. Stacking of Futures**

Stacking is a strategy where a trader initially establishes a large position in nearby futures contracts to hedge a longer-term exposure. As time progresses, these contracts are gradually reduced or rolled into new contracts.

#### **How It Works:**

- A trader enters into a large number of short-term futures contracts at the beginning.
- As the hedge period progresses, some contracts are rolled over or closed.
- The position is gradually adjusted based on market conditions.

#### **Advantages:**

- Provides strong initial hedge protection.
- Can be beneficial in a market with expected interest rate movements.

#### **Disadvantages:**

- Initial over-hedging may cause excessive risk exposure.
- Requires careful management to adjust positions over time.

### **Comparison:**

|Feature|Stripping|Stacking|
|---|---|---|
|Positioning|Small, continuous adjustments|Large initial position, adjusted later|
|Hedge Duration|Uses short-term futures rolled forward|Starts with near-term futures, then reallocated|
|Flexibility|High, as contracts are adjusted frequently|Lower, as it relies on the initial large position|
|Risk Exposure|Less initial exposure, but ongoing adjustments needed|Greater initial exposure, but reduced over time|

Both strategies are commonly used in managing interest rate risk with futures, and the choice between them depends on the traderâ€™s risk appetite, market outlook, and hedging objectives.
