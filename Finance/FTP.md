## In ALM

### FTP (Funds Transfer Pricing)—ALM’s operating system

- **Purpose**:
	- allocate the cost/benefit of
		- funding,
		- liquidity, and
		- IRRBB
	- from ALM to business lines.
- **Approaches**:
    - **Matched-maturity FTP**:
	    - each asset/liability priced at a curve point + liquidity & optionality charges.
    - **Single-pool vs multi-curve**:
	    - separate base rate, [[Liquidity Premiums]], optionality, capital charges.
    - **Behavioural FTP**:
	    - for [[NMD]]s and prepaying assets
	    - (use modelled average lives).
- **Performance**: 
	- product managers *see “true” margin after funding* and *liquidity costs.*
