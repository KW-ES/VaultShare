### **Understanding the Relationship Between Loans, Deposits, and Interest Rate Swaps (IRS)**

To answer your question, we need to break this down into **three key concepts**:

1. **Why Loans Are Considered Assets and Deposits Are Liabilities**
    
2. **The Interest Rate Risk from Funding Long-Term Fixed-Rate Assets with Short-Term Liabilities**
    
3. **How an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) Helps Hedge the Risk**

## **1️⃣ Why Are Loans Considered Assets and Deposits Considered Liabilities?**

### **Loans = Assets**

- When a bank **lends money** (e.g., mortgages, corporate loans), it expects to **receive interest payments and principal repayment** from the borrower.
    
- These future cash inflows (interest and principal) **represent an economic benefit**, which qualifies loans as **assets**.
    
- A **fixed-rate loan** means the bank earns a fixed interest rate over time.
    

### **Deposits = Liabilities**

- When customers deposit money into a bank (e.g., savings accounts, current accounts), the bank **owes this money back to the depositors**.
    
- This means the bank has an **obligation** to repay, which makes deposits a **liability**.
    
- If these deposits are **short-term** (e.g., can be withdrawn anytime or have variable interest rates), the interest rate paid on them can **fluctuate with market rates**.

## **2️⃣ Interest Rate Risk from Funding Long-Term Fixed-Rate Assets with Short-Term Liabilities**

- **You own long-term, fixed-rate assets (loans).** This means you are earning a **fixed interest rate** over many years.
    
- **You fund these loans with short-term, floating-rate liabilities (deposits).** This means the **interest rate you pay on deposits changes over time**.
    

### **Key Risk: Interest Rate Increase**

If interest rates **increase**, the cost of funding (short-term liabilities) **rises**, but your earnings from fixed-rate loans **stay the same**. This **reduces your profit margin**.

Example:

- You gave a **10-year fixed-rate loan at 4%** (earning 4%).
    
- You funded this loan with **short-term deposits at 2%** (paying 2%).
    
- If deposit rates rise to **3.5%**, your funding cost increases, but your loan income remains 4%, reducing your profit margin.
    

This is called a **negative interest rate gap**, which means rising rates **hurt your profitability**.

## **3️⃣ How an Interest Rate Swap (IRS) Helps Hedge This Risk**

To **hedge against rising interest rates**, you want to **receive floating and pay fixed**.

### **Using an IRS to Hedge**

- **Enter into an interest rate swap (IRS) where you pay fixed and receive floating.**
    
- This means you will:
    
    - **Pay a fixed rate** in the swap (which offsets your fixed loan income).
        
    - **Receive a floating rate** in the swap (which helps cover rising deposit costs).
        

This effectively converts your **fixed-rate loans into floating-rate loans**, matching the floating-rate funding, so your exposure to rising rates is reduced.

### **Final Answer:**

- **You should "buy" an Interest Rate Swap (IRS), which means you "pay fixed and receive floating."**
    
- This offsets the risk of rising short-term interest rates increasing your funding costs.
    

✅ **Correct hedge = Buy an IRS = Pay fixed, receive floating.**

## **Summary Table: Interest Rate Risks and Solutions**

|**Scenario**|**Risk Exposure**|**Hedging Strategy (IRS Type)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Fixed-rate assets, floating-rate liabilities** (You earn fixed interest but pay floating interest)|Risk of **rising rates** (funding cost increases)|**Pay fixed, receive floating (Buy IRS)** ✅|
|**Floating-rate assets, fixed-rate liabilities** (You earn floating interest but pay fixed interest)|Risk of **falling rates** (income decreases)|**Pay floating, receive fixed (Sell IRS)**|

---

## **Conclusion: Why This Strategy Works**

- Loans are assets because they generate income.
    
- Deposits are liabilities because they must be repaid.
    
- A mismatch between **long-term fixed-rate assets and short-term floating-rate liabilities** creates **interest rate risk**.
    
- **Hedging with an IRS (pay fixed, receive floating) helps protect against rising interest rates** by converting fixed assets to floating.
