## IRRBB in ALM
### A. Earnings Perspective (short-run)

- **NII sensitivity / EaR**:
	- simulate NII under shocks/paths;
	- include **deposit betas** and **repricing lags**.
- **Scenarios**:
	- parallel ±,
	- steepener/flattener,
	- short-rate only,
	- basis shifts.
- **Behavioral modeling** is critical:
	- NMDs (non-maturity deposits),
	- mortgage prepayments,
	- early redemptions.
### B. Value Perspective (long-run)

- **EVE** under yield-curve shocks;
	- **key-rate duration** to locate where risk sits on the curve.
- Include **embedded option valuation**
	- (e.g., mortgage prepay options via OAS).
