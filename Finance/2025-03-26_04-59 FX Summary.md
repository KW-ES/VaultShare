- Outright = spot +/- swap points
	- Discount then -
	- Premium then +
- ![[Pasted image 20250326170051.png]]
- If countries IR is higher than the other (and it is the base currency) then it is better to buy now than in the future. Hence spot > forward and it is trading at a forward discount. (like contango)
- Quotes
	- USD etc. 28 -> 28/10,000 = 0.0028
	- JPY -> 150 -> 150/100 = 1.5
- Outright fwd cross currency
	- Before crossing the currency, add/subtract the swap points from spot to get the outright quotes
	- Then do cross currency conversions
- ![[Pasted image 20250326170921.png]]
- If need forward points from cross currency
	- get the spots (crossed)
	- have the outright fwd prices
	- then subtract spot from fwd
- ![[Pasted image 20250326171816.png]]
	- USD/AUD (Dollars in AUD) -> 1/(AUD/USD) (AUD in dollars)
	- *just changes the quote*
	- "remember Spot and forward exchange rates (on an outright basis) are always quoted Low – High. The sides of the quote therefore change depending which way any of the above calculations are effected."
- ![[Pasted image 20250326172315.png]]
- Forward foreign exchange deals may be transacted on an option basis - to buy or sell one currency against another for a value date within a pre-determined period in the future.
- **A Time or Delivery option forward exchange contract** is defined as a forward contract where the delivery date of the foreign currency is at the customer's option.
- **A foreign exchange swap** is defined as ‘a simultaneously dealt set of two linked exchange transactions involving the purchase and the sale of an identical amount of one currency against a countercurrency with differing maturities, most frequently spot value against a forward value date’. 
- **Buying or selling base forward**
- **Foreign Exchange Swaps**

	- ![[Pasted image 20250326173256.png]]
- If MM ("my favour") then MU ("Against me")
- If MM ("your favour") then MU ("Against you")
	- MM BID = "Points against me/us" by MM and "Points my favour/our favour" by MU
	- MM OFFER = "Points my favour" by MM and "Points against me"
	- ![[Pasted image 20250326174500.png]]
	- spot = 1.3856
	- + forward rate / swap points
	- = 1.3856 + 0.0054 = 1.3910 -> forward price
	- He (MM) has a loss of 54 points from spot
	- bought higher than spot
- Forward swap
	- MM at offer: (EUR/USD)
		- Spot: Buys EUR 1mill at spot rate and sells USD (1mil * spot)
		- 6m forward: sells EUR 1m at fwd rate (offer) and buys USD (1mil * offer)
		- Offer in swap is how much the MM is willing to sell forward base for (EUR/USD) therefor amount * exchange rate. 
		- ![[Pasted image 20250328075108.png]]
		-  referred to as “Points my favour” by the market maker and “Points against me” by the market user. 
		- remember it's quoted in USD so amount in USD is amount * exchange rate. Euros in USD.
- The fixing of the spot rate is the responsibility of the market maker, and may be set to facilitate the mathematics regarding achieving the forward rate (i.e. base the spot on a rate ending in “0” or “5”, but the market user must always agree that this spot rate is “within the current spread” 
- Base swap rate:
	- In a foreign exchange swap operation it is the **forward points differential** which is all important
		- the exchange of cash flows inherent in the swap operation (typically spot date against a forward value date) being intended to reduce or remove interest rate risk in the two currencies of the swap.
- rates must be fixed within current spread to reflect current rates at time transaction is done
- setting spot:
	- if MM buying and selling base:
		- fix spot rate towards or at LHS of spot rate (i.e. Base bid)
	- if MM selling and buying base:
		- fix spot rate towards or at RHS of spot rate (i.e. Rate offer)
		- For example, if the market maker is buying and selling the base currency he may fix the spot rate towards or at the left hand side of the spot rate (the base currency Bid) resulting in a lower spot cost to the market maker and potentially lower ongoing lower funding cost in terms of the countercurrency. If the market maker is selling and buying base currency he may fix the spot rate towards or at the right hand side of the current spot rate quotation (the base currency Offer) resulting in a higher spot cost to the counterparty and a larger amount of countercurrency available on an ongoing basis to the market maker).

- asset and liability
	- asset = long cash position lent out on short basis
	- liability = deposit
	- Money market cover
		- A long cash position can be lent out (asset) on a short date basis with a short cash position being squared by taking a deposit (liability) for the appropriate short date period.
- Customer requests outright exchange rate for  **TOMORROW ANTE** then seller of GBP TOMORROW
- 2 1/2 points = 2 1/2 / 10,000 = 0.00025
- normal swap
	- add/subtract - premium/discount (don't swap points)
- ante
	- (swap the points) then add/subtract - discount/premium 
	- ![[Pasted image 20250328080736.png]]
	- swap ante quotes: 3 - 2 1/2 (Discount so add)
- ![[Pasted image 20250328080935.png]]
	- both ante O/N and T/N will be Buy/Sell or Sell/Buy
- If quotes are
	- Spot GBP/USD: 1.55 00–05
	- T/N GBP/USD: 3 - 2 ½, (0.0003 - 0.00025).
	- Then base currency (GBP) is at a Discount against USD T/N
	- Therefore Sterling will have a higher interest than USD T/N
	- If at discount, then subtracting the T/N spots will decrease the interest rate (Discount is H-L) meaning the rate will be lower, i.e. Pound is stronger
- fwd/fwd exchange swap
	-  simultaneously dealt set of two linked Exchange transactions involving the Purchase and the Sale of an identical amount of one currency against a countercurrency with **differing maturities, neither of which is spot date.** 
	- 3v6 or "threes/sixes" like FRA's
	- deal on spot but commences from a forward date
	- can be made up of two opposing forward exchange swaps with the different maturities
	- ![[Pasted image 20250328085716.png]]
	- (MU) Buy EUR 3m forward (outright) and sell EUR 6m forward (outright)
	- so use 3m offer and 6m bid = 3v6 fwd/fwd **BID**
	- **MARKET USER WANTS TO SELL FORWARD SO USES MARKET MAKERS FUTURE BID**
	- Market Maker bank covering fwd/fwd transaction (acting as market user covering transacting with his broker)
		- LHS: **BID**
			- At 21
				- sells spot EUR against USD
				- buys EUR back 3m fwd at **21** (EUR Premium) (BID)
					- normal FX forward is how much you buy the base currency for forward
				- ('points against')
			- At 54
				- buys spot EUR against USD
				- sells EUR back 6m fwd at **54** (EUR Premium) (OFFER)
				- ('points his favour')
				- normal FX forward offer is how much you sell base currency forward
			- Net = 54 - 21 (buying) = 33 points dealers favour
		- RHS: **OFFER**
			- MU wants to sell EUR 3m and buy EUR 6m
			- **BUYING FWD** -> **3v6 OFFER**
			- So sells 3m fwd and buys 6m fwd
			- At 18:
				- Buys spot EUR against USD
				- Sells EUR back 3m fwd at 18
				- (EUR premium) "points his favour"
			- At 59
				- Sells spot EUR against USD
				- Buys EUR back 6m fwd at 59
				- (EUR Premium) "points against"
			- Net = 59 - 18 (selling) = 41 points against him
			- Buying EUR 3v6
		- This is the most he will make therefore what he will quote (as a market maker)
		- therefore his BID and OFFER will be
		- 33 - 41 (EUR Premium)
- The **difference between the two forward rates is therefore the points differential dealt at on the forward/forward**, namely 33 points EUR Premium (1.2809 minus 1.2776)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250328102117.png]]
	- spot = 1.2776
	- 6m fwd 1.2809 (1.2809 = spot + 6m bid fwd)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250328102425.png]]
	- **spread or quote market maker provides is how much he knows he can cover himself in the reverse transaction if he was the market user**
- The **BID OR OFFER of a FORWARD SWAP or FWD/FWD SWAP** is based on the MM's  willingness to BUY or SELL to you the most forward date.
	- if you're buying, he's selling
- ![[Pasted image 20250328105637.png]]
	- longer period bid - shorter period offer
	- longer period offer - shorter period bid
	- REMEMBER: If in DISCOUNT then it's subtract therefore those are negative therefore    (1 - (-1)) = (1 + 1)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250328105944.png]]
		- 2v3
			- 2 - (-1) = +3 for BID
			- 7 - (-6) = +13 for OFFER
- When setting the rates for an FX swap to extend the maturity, **the spot rate should be fixed immediately within the current spread**, to **reflect current rates at the time the transaction was done**.
- historic rate roll-over formula
	- ![[Pasted image 20250328110607.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250328120143.png]]
- Person wants to bring swap back by a month
	- if original swap was sell, then they do buy.
	- so they (MM) do a 2v3
	- buy 2m, sell 3m
	- MM buys at BID, so use BID spot rate
	- They originally bought EUR 10,000,000.00 at 0.80 00 = GBP 8,000,000.00
	- Now they will pay GBP 8,306,000.00 (**MM BID** on 31st May 202X  (first leg of swap)
		- MU is now entering swap to change position
		- In this example the original outright forward contract (Bank sells EUR) remains on the book but will eventually be off-set against the forward leg of the swap (Bank buys EUR)
	- The EUR amounts will be compensated and the difference of GBP 320,000.00* (GBP 8,320,000.00 less 8,000,000.00) will be paid on this date by the market making bank to the corporate customer. The ‘all-in’ cost to the corporate customer buying EUR 10,000,000.00 on the earlier date of 31st May 202X is therefore GBP 7,986,000.00 (8,306,000.00 less 320,000.00) on 31st May 202X.
- Interest Arbitrage
	- Interest arbitrage is the link between the Eurocurrency money markets via the forward exchange market
	- In such a currency, consider the situation where a bank dealer has quoted and dealt with a corporate customer on an outright basis and subsequently covered the currency exposure by a reverse spot operation. If there are no means available to cover the resultant forward exchange time position via a foreign exchange swap transaction, or exchange controls prohibit it, **the mismatched currency cashflows can be squared by a liability in one and an asset in the other currency for the period in question. The initial spot and forward outright deals must in this case be identified together as a swap and treated as interest arbitrage.**
	- e.g. dealer looking for funding of EUR asset by taking USD deposit
		- uses the forward EUR/USD market in a 'covered' IR situation
	- forward swap points are equivalent to difference in the interest rates in the two currencies concerned for the period quoted.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250328124930.png]]
		- because of what we said above, forward points are the difference in interest rates in the currencies
		- can calculate
			- swap points
			- maximum funding rate possible
			- or minimum asset return necessary to reach equilibrium (no profit no loss 'break-even' rate)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250328130047.png]]
		- Market user funds this FX swap by buying EUR spot and selling 6m forward EUR (180 days) against USD on the 6m swap price using those quotes from the market maker. **54 - 59**
		- It's "his favour" so he's buying at the lower price.
		- Buying spot and selling forward EUR (BID)
		- ![[Pasted image 20250328130238.png]]
		- remember swap is simultaneous exchange of currencies (at spot/at fwd)
			- so buys and sells EUR / sells and buys USD
		- what you buy (EUR) will be the fixed amount. the counter currency amount (USD) is what changes based on the exchange rate. i.e. how many USD can you get for the EUR
		- Next part is the deposit
		- funds the 6m USD cash requirement with a matching USD deposit
			- The 6 months (180 days) USD Money market rate is currently quoted:
				- 2.88 - 2.988361 p.c.
				- The funding dealer takes a six months deposit in the amount of USD 13,850,000.00 (the exact Spot date cash requirement) at the offered rate of **2. 988361 p.c.** (# the calculated USD interest rate)
				- buying a deposit's offer rate = 2.988... so that's what they take (what's quoted in the market)
		-  ![[Pasted image 20250328132116.png]]
		- you have the interest you earned on the euros and the interest on the USD you paid
		- (You get interest from the EUR loan and pay interest on the USD deposit)
		- ![[Pasted image 20250328132407.png]]
		- you get the EUR 110,000 and then sell to USD (using exchange rate of 1.3904 which is the spot + 6m fwd points of 54)
		- This gives you the USD amount in 6m to get 152,944
		- add what you got for the USD swap
		- and then offset it with the USD interest payment
		- ![[Pasted image 20250328132942.png]]
		- you loan the money so at forward date it comes back with interest (EUR loan)
		- deposit is opposite of loan. (liability)
		- at spot you got the USD money but in future you repay it (with interest) (deposit / liability)
		- swaps:
			- spot:
				- purchase 10mil EUR at spot i.e: (10,000,000 EUR IN)
				- sell 13.85mil USD (13,850,000 USD OUT)
			- future
				- sell 10mil EUR at 6m swap rate i.e. (10,000,000 EUR OUT)
				- purchase 13.904mil USD (13,904,000 USD IN)
		- Then you sell the EUR interest received (from the loan) at the 6m rate (forward outright contract)
			- 110,000 EUR OUT
			- 152,944 USD IN
	- **Purchasing USD interest payable and EUR interest receivable AND swap benefit**
	- The EUR interest receivable must be sold to produce sufficient US Dollars (net of interest and swap points) to meet the interest payable
	- to achieve zero sum, the EUR interest receivable (the 110,000 from the loan) must be sold forward at the same rate as the forward leg of the FX swap (i.e. 6m rate)
	- The calculations above only “compute” if in every case the forward interest receivable in the asset currency is converted to the countercurrency at the same Outright forward rate as the forward leg of the interest arbitrage swap.
- ![[Pasted image 20250328134744.png|600]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20250328134817.png|350]]
	- Get the forward rate from the swap points (spot + swap points)
	- The one for EUR is the **MINIMUM** interest rate return which must be achieved on the EUR asset when dealing at 54 points
- Swap points calculating (from base and counter currency interest rates)
	- 2 Interest rates were EUR = 2.20pc and USD = 2.988.. pc
	- 	- ![[Pasted image 20250328135443.png|500]]
	- Swap points:
		- BASE - Positive -> Forward Premium (L-H)
		- BASE - Negative -> Forward Discount  (H-)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250328140608.png|450]]
	- Then swap points = Outright - Spot rate = swap points
	- IR Arbitrage Checklist:
		- To <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">raise</mark> **BASE** currency or <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">lend</mark> **COUNTER** currency
			- Just read these:
			- ![[Pasted image 20250328141329.png]]
			- You want more base currency
			- you are SELLING base currency on the swap
				- so you use MM's BID for forward base currency (to sell later)
			- You sold variable currency spot
			- so borrow Variable currency now
			- your position with variable currency is square
			- and you are long (have) Base currency
			- Now need to fund the costs of buying the base currency spot
			- If the base currency is at a DISCOUNT, add the cost to the variable currency interest rate
			- if the base currency is at a PREMIUM, subtract the cost from the variable currency interest rate
			- Choosing quote:
			- ![[Pasted image 20250328141347.png]]
			- **CHOOSE LEAST POINTS AGAINST YOU AND MOST IN YOUR FAVOUR**
		- To lend **BASE** currency or rase **COUNTER** currency
			- ![[Pasted image 20250328142517.png]]
				- HERE you're **LENDING** the variable currency to square your position with the swap
			- ![[Pasted image 20250328142530.png]]
			- If it's at a DISCOUT, want highest  points, if it's at a PREMIUM, want lowest points
			- ![[Pasted image 20250328142541.png]]

- NDF
	- Contract of Difference
	- FX equivalent of FRA
	- Cash-settled Contract of difference
	- notional never exchanged
	- Off balance sheet
	- only exchange cashflows diff between NDF rate and spot market rate exchanged on settlement date
