A sell/buy back is a type of Securities Financing Transaction (SFT) that's similar to a repurchase agreement (repo), but it's structured as two separate transactions:

1. First Transaction (Sell leg):

- Party A sells securities to Party B at the current market price
- This happens at the start of the agreement

2. Second Transaction (Buy leg):

- Party A agrees to buy back the same securities at a future date
- The repurchase price includes an implied financing rate

Key differences from a standard repo:

- Structured as two distinct transactions rather than one agreement
- Coupon payments during the transaction period typically belong to the buyer (Party B)
- Less legal protection compared to repos (since it's two separate trades)
- Often used in markets where legal/tax framework for repos isn't well established

Example:

- Bank A sells $10 million of bonds to Bank B for immediate settlement
- Simultaneously, they agree Bank A will buy them back in 3 months
- The repurchase price will include the original price plus financing costs

Main uses:

- Short-term financing
- Accessing specific securities
- Alternative to standard repos in certain jurisdictions
- Yield enhancement strategies

The key risk compared to repos is that since it's two separate transactions, there's potentially more counterparty risk if one party defaults between the two legs of the trade.
