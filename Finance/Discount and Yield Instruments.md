- **Yield Instruments:** These are interest-bearing instruments that pay periodic interest or accrue interest over time, with the investor receiving both principal and accrued interest at maturity. CDs fall into this category as they typically have a stated interest rate and pay interest periodically or at maturity.
    
- **Discount Instruments:** These are issued at a discount to their face value and do not pay periodic interest; instead, the investor earns a return by purchasing the instrument at a lower price and receiving the full face value at maturity. Examples include **Treasury bills and commercial paper.**

Yield means starts higher and becomes par
Discount means starts low and accrues to face value
e.g. 

### **Example Calculation for a Discounted Bankers' Acceptance (BA)**

#### **Given Data:**

- **Face Value (FV):** $1,000,000
- **Discount Rate:** 5.25% per annum
- **Days to Maturity:** 90 days

#### **Step 1: Calculate the Discount Amount**

The discount amount is the difference between the face value and the purchase price. It is calculated as:

#### **Step 2: Calculate the Purchase Price**

The investor buys the BA at a discount from face value:

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Investor's Yield (Effective Yield or Money Market Yield, MMY)**

Since the investor earns $13,125 over 90 days, the **money market yield (MMY)** is:

### **Summary of Results:**

- **Purchase Price:** $986,875
- **Discount Earned:** $13,125
- **Investorâ€™s Annualized Yield (MMY):** 5.33%

This example demonstrates how a BA functions as a **discount instrument**, where the return is earned through the difference between the purchase price and face value.
