## Balance-Sheet Mechanics & Core Concepts

- **Repricing**:
	- when an instrument’s coupon or rate resets; 
	- **maturity**:
		- when principal is due.
- **Gaps**:
	- timing mismatches between asset and liability repricing/maturity buckets.
- **Duration & convexity**
	- (value perspective): 
		- sensitivity of present value to rate shifts.
- **Cash-flow structure**:
	- amortizing vs bullet;
	- fixed vs floating;
	- caps/floors;
	- embedded options.
